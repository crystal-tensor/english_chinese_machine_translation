123	126	oh, hey, uh, ben, beth. What A...
118	356	What do you mean? - You go to haiti, and... I take this job.
159	353	with all the talk about the possible Supreme Court appointment and all...
117	454	Is for me to tell you what it is.
149	543	All right. All right. He's watching us too closely to get the guns.
140	517	Knowing what someone wants can tell you a lot about who they are,
156	139	Where's all this coming from exactly?
111	497	No! -- That's why you want money.
123	475	Does this mean I can't tease you anymore?
131	434	Can you get his head? - Leah, my wife... Is she okay?
140	444	Maybe that, uh... helped clear up your schedule.
119	60	And what is the harm if Kevin and Jason haen to have a cup of coffee together?
137	1357	I thought, I'm gonna die before the cadillac losesits new-car smell.
125	350	I was thinking that maybe you could do it, hmm?
146	45	You can help with the charger.
146	100	Look, let's not worry about Mike. He's just Mike. - not right now, he isn't.
132	160	Well, he loves you. He wants you in new york with him.
142	468	No, he's hurt bad. It was just Brennen's version of a pep talk.
162	627	He has changed, He's much stronger.
154	654	If Vanek gets swept up by the Feds, they're gonna become radioactive.
162	1264	It's my sister. She's not been well.
124	205	Well, hopefully it's something that you haven't seen in a long time.
160	286	I'm just gettin' guess-- just kind out of shape…
141	204	He moved in when Robert got sick.
123	418	Come on in. It's all right. Don't be afraid.
132	163	No. No. No, there - There is no catch.
131	611	I - I embarrassed myself in front of her entire family.
128	392	Thanks, Rah. - That's what I'm talking about.
119	223	Look, um, I -- I know you only know me as a demented hair yanker, but I can actually appear to be quite normal sometimes -- I'm sure. -- I -- so I was wondering if
135	482	Well, there are a couple thingsyou could clear up for me.
164	298	Adaptations to locate and store water are crucial for survival.
141	106	Michael, I don't need help killing someone.
163	447	No, Polly, I'm sorry, but there is no other choice.
126	641	I don't know how many lemons and oranges
120	679	Well, they weren't exactly the most inviting, and you're right, Wade is an asshat.
121	23	And so right now in the hallway, I... I... I ran into him, - and I thought I would set him straight about a few facts. - Oh, Nora.
112	500	It can trash all the mast, the rigging, the lines, the wheelhouse, everything, but it's not going to...
145	214	I'm going to have to treat you as bad as I treat him or even worse.
117	259	So what do you think you're gonna do?
127	44	All right? It's never happened to us, and every time I try and talk to you about it, - you're running out the door.  - 'Cause I'd rather be at the gym.
156	121	I haven't been back here since...
151	159	There wasn't nothing behind those eyes.
145	449	Most of the time, you won't need it, but if it turns out your target is on to you...
146	593	Now, no one can make you stop not until you're ready.
164	211	and how they might have evolved...
152	490	Man, that Trixie was a fun gal, wasn't she?
131	403	Just- They're going through so much, and I thought it would be
111	263	I really did think I was helping her, like I was stopping her from making some decision that she was gonna regret.
146	284	It shouldn't be too hard to sneak in once he's gone.
145	39	That guy? He looks like he's about to eat the worm.
141	324	Drew, dead. Jeannie, dead. The houseguest, dead.
122	437	I'm afraid she means it. - Yes.
163	507	We're going to split you up, go over your histories, and see if there's a name from your past in common.
130	363	Children... you know how it is.
113	152	That must be nice. I've only ever lived here.  - Must be nice.
112	518	Less than a mile offshore, the canyon drops down to a whopping 2, 600'.
154	469	Fine. We're making our way to the rear door now.
147	510	This guy's playing you! Take your gun off me and shoot him!
115	695	Come. Come on. Please, please, all of you, just march back in there right now.
154	500	Do you want to hide behind a box of splinters, or do you want to try this again?
136	297	GREG N BONNIE COMING. GET OUT
140	551	Good for you. Look at you.
141	325	The coke dealer, anyone you hired, et cetera.
146	55	I don't think some old files are the problem, fi.
113	97	Is that her?  - Must be. What is she wearing?
113	389	And then when I'm 64, I'll hang myself.
126	445	Mine are all good. - I lost four?
155	1353	They weren't just going to forget everything that happened and release you.
131	382	Look, I haven't finished my thesis yet, and I told you, I've been working on this novel.
116	199	I never said I was going to stop chemo, Sarah.
130	87	I'm Nora Walker. - Nora Walker. Yes.
150	345	Now, check with your police buddy. See if they missed something.
111	141	And, this, of course, is Emma.
161	136	Yo, hold on!  - What is this?
113	62	We have to finish these. Do them tonight.  - Mom, you know what happens...
137	1358	I'd never let that happen, Sam.
137	493	Once Kent has that heroin, we can use it to bring him down.
122	226	Kitty, how can you listen to this submoronic gas bag?
118	480	It's great for people like you, because it's spring cleaning for you.
147	150	Jesse. Looks like Cahill's mystery date has finally arrived.
118	3	It's your mom. - You've got to be kidding me.
126	614	And if this is about Rebecca and Justin,
145	393	I'm sorry. I'm just so scared.
133	174	They were together take them both
124	278	Oh, it's good to see you. - It's good to see you, too, Saul.
111	174	We understand you're focused on this new child, but Emma's still our child, and we have to put her first.
125	389	Listen to me. Aunt Kitty is sick.
146	186	I don't like your ugly shirt, I don't like your smart mouth, and I don't like you.
129	351	That is what you mean, isn't it, Nora?
115	381	But my relationship with David. There is no future.
128	356	Video games or not, Cooper has been acting out.
126	428	Now you see, Paige, if you keep working on your science,
120	692	It got Dubya into the White House.
163	472	You know, it's one thing for Brooke to pay for your mistakes, but if my daughter has to pay for them, too
122	642	So are you still gonna marry Kitty?
140	354	That must be where Eddie's heading.
163	174	We have to assume the people who abducted these girls were members of the community.
126	299	Remember when we used to steal this out of Sarah's room and take it to the beach?
124	533	Wh-- oh, my god. I'm outta here, man. - What? Don'T. Come...
123	41	Hi. - Um, may I please grab my toothbrush?
146	334	R7283t that's your license plate, and I am calling the cops.
118	27	I love you. - Firemen? Kitty, I love firemen.
161	262	They irritate the shit out of me. I felt Iike...
137	738	Great. What are we gonna do about it?
139	451	Look, fi, the truth is, I didn't think any of it mattered, 'cause I wasn't the marrying type until now.
164	340	about the size, shape, and behavior of creatures...
155	1110	We're doing surveillance on a CIA officer.
136	42	All these years, I don't know who in the hell you work for.
152	216	That's my girlfriend, Dawn, behind us.
140	319	So when you take off your floaties and you want to do some real business,
132	141	I believe that's a violation of fire code.
155	403	Well, what can you do for me here?
144	701	Minute he hits the stand, the Turks are done.
149	508	Whoever's behind this is making their move right now. How do I know it wasn't you?
164	76	probably, likely in the marine environment...
158	178	And she should have turned off the light first because now she's gonna be－
148	572	You can go around them, which is tough if there's a full surveillance team, or you can give them a reason to leave.
144	665	You can't have an explosion without plenty of heat and pressure.
154	433	Well, at least according to the warning labels.
115	199	I'll dead bolt the thing, for god sakes. Just.
145	133	I'm gonna get another drink -- another rum and coke.
165	144	I have so much to show you.
128	664	We're having a baby in seven months.
142	77	Just think of me as, uh... your new boss.
119	638	Everyone can hear you! What are you thinking?
127	59	She... she just thinks I'm kidding.
159	33	I want you to give me one...
147	171	Our security is excellent. - Care to be more specific?
164	141	that will surround a peena-pod or a colony of them...
144	360	I say the word, and Jesse's back in.
129	493	Sure. - Okay, well, he called me today, and an agent saw the pictures, and you're never gonna believe it, but I got a meeting.
138	213	Come alone -- I guess that was too hard to understand.
142	128	Great. Why don't we just throw a judge in there while we're at it?
153	250	You probably got pocket-dialed by some hobo in University Park.
123	539	I just wanted to let you know that I found bridget...
131	130	Hey, sarah.   -  Hal, long time, man.
145	101	My firm handles their security here in town.
155	642	Unless the CIA is raiding an abandoned auto-parts store, this is it.
155	1299	I got a bit of bad news for you.
153	104	The son of a bitch who killed Tom is probably still in this building.
130	257	Oh, yeah. I could even see the crystal paperweight that I used to keep on the edge of my desk.
142	86	You could tell me what we're doing.
125	373	I'm in. - Oh, me, too.
146	607	Just little things you know, fuel receipts and docking papers money transfers to nowhere.
145	501	She can tell us how to find her through the cellphone. Just let her go.
155	1123	It looks like Riley's going to meet her cartel friends.
130	722	Go get 'em, champ. - Yeah, break a leg.
154	129	And sometimes, just as important as keeping your enemy out is holding your team in.
132	448	Who gives a crap whether the glutens bind or not?
132	446	Then you mush it all together with your fingers, add just a little bit of water, otherwise the glutens won't bind.
111	123	I just chipped in 300 bucks for the champagne.
136	71	I need to know what they asked you, what you told them.
126	74	I can double-check the labs. - Not that three isn't great. Are you-- are you okay?
140	212	People have too much faith in padlocks.
122	725	That's when I'll stop going to funerals.
142	210	Johnny. John dickson. And I do the windows.
118	388	You know, it's not typical, but it can happen.
147	33	I'll, uh, I'll send him the photos and see if he comes back with anything.
154	371	Uh, maybe we send Schmidt out to talk to Vanek.
114	1	You know there's a better way to do this...
116	144	Uh, clearly, it is not an indoor game.
160	403	Wow. Wow, that felt really relaxed.
116	50	Sorry. Didn't mean to scare ya.
126	201	Bone-- bone-break fever? That's its name? - Yes, and for good reason.
145	106	The girls think they'll get jobs if they go. But, instead, they are forced to...
162	1426	And these are for your friend.
118	274	Have you guys ever heard of "citizens for a corrupt-free America"?
149	415	That fake rock of yours doesn't fool anybody. Well, why wouldn't you just
113	441	I promised your mother and I want to.  - No, I d... Amma.
132	517	And what, I can't even - I can't even visit you?
131	100	I think what Jill wants to see here is our ability to handle whatever comes our way, including this.
113	682	The curse is gonna claim her, Macon.
127	719	Oh, no, no. I... I can drink. I... I'm good at it now.  - Really?
131	591	And I can show you around if you want.
146	24	At this rate, they should be married by 60.
124	195	The doctor says you get to take a shower today. Let's get him up.
152	536	It's good to meet you, Quinn.
155	1065	You sure you don't need help?
121	607	Look, um, I think you and I were both afraid of being rejected...
145	364	I mean, look, Mike's really gonna have to come after you so Takeda doesn't think something's up.
113	387	I'll move into an apartment above the Wayward Dog bar...
117	58	Luc, did you give me cookies?
132	557	I thought I would find you here.
147	392	I do not like our odds. - Then let's even them out.
113	357	A bunch of sexually frustrated housewives...
142	256	A tire iron is great if you need a new tire.
118	277	Well, you... You do fly around California in a private jet.
120	681	You know, being with those people today, it just...reminded me of being a kid.
157	136	So, if Carlais still using agricultural specialist as a cover, chances are pretty good that he's heard of her.
125	305	Enchante. Je suis l'oncle de Sarah.
132	710	Yeah? Why don't you go with courtney? - Oh, they are so excited to have you, Evan.
126	9	But if you want me to eat poison...
156	216	The meeting's set. Cody's waiting for me.
112	173	Whereas squid only use their arms to catch prey and to put it in their mouth.
137	943	It was like a 15-year-old pontiac, ma.
113	61	You get away now! Go on!  - Come on, I gotta take him to school!
124	460	You know, the two of you have a very unique way of expressing your love for the people who care about you.
147	172	I need to know about intrusion-detection systems, security-response procedures, the whole nine.
112	42	These two guys know more than anyone about the giant Pacific octopus.
131	460	uh, This chicken is delicious. - Thank you.
123	224	He runs his own architecture firm now. - Really?
119	311	Yeah, that's pretty much how it works, so...
151	82	I'll release him the moment I'm home free.
111	177	The truth is that Hannah and I had been talking about having another baby, anyway, so...
130	132	So limo duty again, huh? - Yes, yes.
112	307	You can see a big lump.
155	754	I swear to you I'll make this right, Sam.
116	45	No, Kevin, Kevin, that's Kluve the crusader. - Who? !
134	663	Well, it sounds like losing Erik put a big dentin Quinn Luna's business.
163	124	You'd be surprised to know how many times we hear that.
148	283	We cleared all the buildings. - The computer doesn't lie.
158	412	Listen. l am so sorry for－
118	740	Oh, cool. - We're right behind you.
161	420	Don't make me Billy Jack your ass.
142	598	Mr. Westen. May I have a word?
150	418	She was talking about the files that we got, so believe me
158	16	But, you see, l－ l'm on the list. l'm ''plus one.''
121	396	Ooh! Uh, Kimberly, you know what? Table seven... - Uh, Angie, would you mind going to the storeroom...
151	428	Uh, no. No. Not at all.
146	595	What do you think I should do, Nate?
145	426	Yes. Yes. I miss you, too.
159	125	As usual, my son grossly exaggerates the issue.
113	575	And I'd say, “Mom, I'm 9. How do I do that?”
156	306	Besides, Cody was at the club last night when we blacked it out.
127	295	I know. And I'm sure that Dennis did things for William that are best left where they are, but as you said, that was a lifetime ago, Nora.
150	238	Got to warn you, though - if you're looking for a free drink, I’m not the guy.
131	604	Good morning. Is that the only name you're gonna give us?
116	318	Is that the one where you gain weight? Are you saying that I gained weight?
112	328	We're going to haul a long roll of fabric to the top of the mast, simulating what a tentacle would look like.
134	169	I'm sorry. I-I think that -- I thinkI'm wasting your time.
149	556	Never know what kind of crazy idea's just gonna ...pop into their pop into their crazy, little warlord head. Crazy, little warlord head.
113	483	Satan has nothing to do with y'all, right?
117	199	Want me to bake the cake?
139	100	I got my G. E. D.. I got certified as a mechanic, and now I'm tryingto stay clean, no matter what.
160	316	I've already looked into it for myself.
118	38	What, are you in college? - Tastes good cold.
149	256	You make it sound so easy. It is, Ma.
144	158	Maybe the guy thought dropping two feds was a dumb thing to do.
140	621	You're what's wrong with our country, pal.
117	655	So now what can I do? How can I help you?
128	608	How did you miss that? - Sorry, I got distracted.
164	459	it ranges from extremely cold to extremely hot...
156	400	Yeah, that's not going to happen.
121	272	She invited us to dinner tonight.
136	572	Of course, you could help us find him, testify for a reduced sentence, and only get, I don't know, 5 to 10.
123	216	Look, Scotty, I may be able to get an iffy ticket thrown out, but next time, will you please take a cab?
145	342	But I can't help you if I'm dead, and he wants you to take the shot.
122	348	You know what? I have to go, though, okay? Bye.
158	135	l don't need another loser waitress here. Okay, Mac. Okay.
163	4	The question is: When victory and defeat, life and death, hang in the balance, what are you capable of?
144	550	Yeah, uh, this is Mr. "Vain" talking at you.
154	350	Vanek, you want to talk, you'll talk to me.
142	536	I am so good, in fact, that I can put it all back, right now, if you let us go.
129	436	Yes. Yes, it's-it's a show of accomplishment.
155	805	Often, the most you can do is sterilize whatever tools you have on hand, keep the wound clean, and hope for the best.
146	604	As the cia was rounding up all the people who burned me,
162	1723	I want you to know that, no matter what happens... we'll always have each other.
117	157	This is a family business, and we're all family now. Yeah, come on.
117	190	Oh, god. I hope you're right.
111	33	So how do you even know?
141	218	You have to trust me. It's gonna be all right.
136	480	He won't even answer my calls.
117	743	So you're... You're completely right in having this party.
117	456	Well, let... Let's, uh, let's see how that works.
127	37	Are you... are you gonna maybe talk about what happened?
163	345	There's a name in there, John Sherman, you're not going to find it in the state computer.
155	1003	If it doesn't work, it's probably 'cause I'm dead.
115	43	I'm having a big family dinner on saturday. Why don't you join us?
113	925	I have to hide some for myself, because Link never shares.
113	170	Oh, my God, you mean Ethan Wate drove me home?
138	374	Please, fiona. I think I know who the thieves are here.
122	187	Ah, so this is it-- the kitchen.
148	407	What redirect? - You got jokes?
137	1213	Why is it, if you're the responsible one, every time you run off and you do your spy thing, I got to pick up the pieces?
153	106	Well, I thought we were screwed seven ways from Sunday, but you can go ahead and make it eight and nine.
125	298	Oh, for god sake. Has everyone in this family lost his mind?
161	509	This stuff holds a lot of sentimental value.
119	593	Hell no. You blithely push me into a situation where I unknowingly make a jackass of myself?
146	243	That's pretty small. This is really going to lead us to his place?
127	357	Sarah, w... why don't you just marry Luc?
145	14	It's often better to force the person you're chasing to go faster than the terrain allows and wait for them to make a mistake.
112	504	Use the body weight to drag the ship under.
152	347	Once it's time to spike your target's drink,the important thing is to control the dose.
146	136	This guy Carter, he hangs out at jal alal. It's down on 37th. I was thinking we could do some - after you drop me off, your move is going home. - what?
112	267	Yeah. Good. Yeah? Were you sick?
164	280	that could stay airborne for as long as they need.
127	290	I know the last person in the world you want to hear about is Dennis York, but you are giving him too much power.
122	371	What can I do? - That's true.
155	105	We tried living our life separated by glass, it didn't work out.
113	327	Don't be a snob, uncle. It's not their fault you never speak to any of them.
152	285	I'll make a call, set up a meet.
132	363	Well - You tell it, you die. I'm serious.
160	436	These are some serious ''NuPont'' fiber-woven bowls.
137	282	Plus, we're gonna get some more help -- a little relief from the bullpen.
116	715	Oh, god, that's him. That's gotta be him.
115	189	Then why is it that we're telling everybody that we broke up?
162	120	Do you think Mum would have had the baby yesterday if we hadn't moved house?
120	661	This is...lovely, even though it's spinning.
164	184	because, of all the zoos in the country right now...
125	175	Look, this is a huge step, and I'd rather do it the normal way, which is through an agency.
139	299	I usually work for safe companies, you know, when grandma forgets the combination or the bank manager forgets the security code.
115	642	I traded my loft in soho for this beach bungalow in venice.
125	379	Well, if I lived in Italy, I would eat gelato every day.
156	476	We have the password to the server room, the log-in to their network, and I can override the cameras to cover your path down the back staircase and into this hall here.
119	260	How long? -- For what? Like, it was...
152	665	Tell your boys to back off, or this will get ugly.
148	461	Okay. I'll call you back in 10.
148	490	This'll keep him out for a while.
155	475	Well, you have to forgive me if I don't just take your word for it.
154	591	When you're there, I will send Schmidt over, and then my friends and I, we get to leave.
140	61	Sam, this, uh... This could get bad.
127	391	Uh, Rebecca is not here. No. Just, uh, just me.
161	393	Did you get hurt?  - No.
132	453	do I want to hear this?
162	176	OK, calm down. Wait. I dunno!
156	59	Well, that wasn't your call to make, was it?
148	373	Turns out Marsden's an explosives expert.
158	140	Well, see, l－ l'd hoped he would hire you as a waitress or something.
112	487	Oh, way thicker. Oh, then yeah, yeah.
122	141	Are you crazy? You don't have a home anymore. We are running for president.
156	801	We got a lot more from the hackers than we expected.
148	293	If I got my count wrong...Why is this coffee still hot?!
150	586	She said she didn't want to let you keep working for Anson anymore, and she didn't want to run and let the bastard get away.
164	510	Here some creatures may have evolved eyes.
118	433	Robert, can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure.
112	265	We need to find a tall ship, get out on the water, and figure out how our Kraken would take it down.
144	436	I'm supposed to fill in the blanks by spotting Bailey's car, so how's that APB coming?
146	508	You got him? - yeah, he's safe, but he's not our biggest fan.
127	293	I mean it.  - You forget how far back this all goes.
128	681	But now there's a whole new member of the family, and we think you might be finding it a bit challenging. hmm?
140	244	And that is something you can take to Valentine.
164	301	would be a death sentence for almost any Earth creature.
153	139	I don't know. They got all the king's horses and all the king's men surrounding that hotel.
132	695	Okay, and I'll definitely call in once a day, just to say hi and ...
121	652	Is my mother up yet? - Yes. She's in the kitchen.
114	16	Travel the world in a different million ways...
132	563	I'm - I'm sorry, too, for flying off the handle.
119	45	I'm Jason... McCallister, Bobby's younger brother.
130	487	I'm talking about your passive-aggressive behavior, Sarah. - My passive-aggressive...
150	213	So, you're telling me you have no positions. You're not hiring.
152	714	The C. I.A. found out about my approach to Meyerson.
114	220	I don't know a single decent person who could get used to that.
137	9	A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... -should we shoot them?
150	180	Wait's over. You ready? - Let’s do this.
147	468	The files disappear? He lays a whole mess at your feet.
114	475	Josh, they're on the way, man!
145	257	What was she talking about, Michael?
153	489	Mike, you use that phone, Riley's gonna hear everything you say.
112	259	No, and you're right, though. They have to be really stretchy, don't they?
122	493	Hi, captain edwards. I'm Justin's doctor.
117	514	Who am I kidding? I'm totally freaking out waiting for Michelle's call.
126	637	I think that York knows something about the value of Ojai that I don't.
132	115	I have a car coming for me in an hour.
162	1110	They're slow-moving little critters, these are.
156	195	Maybe we can help you out with that.
128	663	Although I have been behaving like one recently.
158	117	S. O.L? ''Shit out of luck.''
137	344	I know you got a sweet smuggling racket over at that sxg facility.
134	160	Well, his brother Quinn's a gangster.
165	234	No, your only false friend is the one who's placed this mischievous piece of nonsense.
127	590	And you know what? It takes time, all right?
156	42	The target is a hacker group out of Coral Gables.
136	104	Uh, do you -- Do you have anything that, uh...
155	664	Breach? why would you have to
128	476	Yeah. - The house was amazing.
140	708	People don't drive when their tires are on fire.
150	114	Travels pretty heavy? - make that very heavy.
131	233	Well, tell him to drink more.
116	387	Oh, my god. Do you remember that time you ripped out the shoulder pads from one of my jackets...
152	116	Mike's gonna be wearing a tracker the whole time.
132	25	I'm just gonna stop by my office and make sure that I have everything, and then I'm probably gonna do a few errands
136	29	I really don't notice what my neighbors do.
145	318	What kind of party you got going on in here, huh?
155	374	I find a nice, dark hole somewhere to throw you into.
156	123	Found a few snow globes you might be able to salvage.
126	613	That's gonna more than make up for what you lost in your savings.
149	50	I think they're getting serious. Do we really have to talk about that right now?
158	583	Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. l'm okay.
149	397	Is it? How convenient. - What?
117	465	All right, you can walk out of here anyway you want.
119	431	See, you're not wearing one either.
142	87	Uh, pass. You're just a key, Michael.
141	166	What you're doing with this event, it's extraordinary.
142	574	You know, I thought I was here to land this big deal, and... and instead...
115	272	Mom need never know how much of a disappointment you both actually are, unless that's what you want.
113	139	You've never seen it?  - No.
133	81	Apparently, there's some ukrainian who's very upset about an op you ran in the '90s.
126	356	Yes, she did. - Yes, I did. Yes, I did. I did, very much. 100%.
164	389	that drape along the countryside as they slowly move and float over the scenery.
116	553	I was thinking of wearing my Kluve the crusader outfit tomorrow,
126	625	Trust me, David. I have looked at this at every single angle.
124	462	You seemed pretty upset to me.
113	1277	Emily's mom says she was in a mental institution.
132	285	No. No, in fact, it might even be longer.
161	799	I'm so sorry.  - Why did I catch a sword?
125	567	No, I don't think either one of us should lead or follow.
126	117	I just talked to the insurance adjustors the other day,
118	175	Well, thank you. Thank you, mom.
158	642	No. Listen. l swear l'm not crazy, okay? Our luck did get switched.
134	171	Seriously, what can you do that the police can't?
131	188	after robbing the dean's cradle, Kitty m-or should I say cougar Walker Mccallister, has been teaching at wexley university for the past month - Stop.
131	256	Okay, but if she feels neglected and starts,
163	364	We played football together in high school.
153	94	They're not guarding the 2nd- floor access to the garage.
134	575	It takes some doing, but when you pull it off, it's more devastating than a bullet.
146	432	It doesn't matter. There's nothing to find.
126	353	Sarah, just because I hear what he has to say does not make me the village idiot.
146	602	I’m sorry, fi. I just I found a thread, and when i pulled at it Michael, I’m worried.
156	527	Who are you? - Oh, that's not important.
115	345	And then ironically, by not talking, I was called a hero, a distinction that I never asked for.
129	243	No, I don't want to follow Dr. Alex. I don't want to do that.
156	318	After that, we thought it wise to make ourselves hard to find.
125	492	And you know how Paige is when she thinks I'm treating her like a child.
118	526	I'm starting to feel really weird about this.
146	226	Fine. But if this goes sideways, Vegas, some gator's going to be making swamp fertilizer out of you, too.
156	154	Mike goes in, does a little type-type on the keyboard, we do something in the real world that makes him look like a computer genius.
146	592	I’m not telling you to stop doing what you're doing, all right?
128	742	Did Justin talk to you about wanting to go back to Afghanistan?
129	85	Look, I’m -I’m just ranting. I got a phone call.
131	439	Hibreathing is labored. Let's get him some o-2 and ready for transport. - Got it.
126	616	No, see, you're just not getting it.
145	569	Maybe it's time to just leave the past in the past.
118	743	Or I don't know, maybe david and I will get married there.
124	364	Where's the other one? There are two.
132	473	Are you gonna be all right? - yes!
146	570	I know you got to go talk to Jessica, but come on I’ll buy you a beer.
121	63	Um, Angie, have you met my brother Kevin? - Uh, nice to meet you.
125	248	You are familiar with the Lasgrove investment fund?
119	117	Well, I hope you weren't expecting turkey, 'cause they seem to have all gone quickly this year.
162	943	Mr Myers passed away in the vicinity of the kitchen, whilst partaking of a bottle of fine ale!
155	1040	Examination bay" -- I like the sound of that.
127	457	William was doing on several parcels of land, including one named...
115	402	Kitty. -it's the height of hypocrisy.
117	398	You have to care about the carrots.
137	435	I have a meeting to get to, so if we could wrap this up...
136	81	They got all of her bank-Account numbers.
122	253	No, no, no, no! Mom, no!
147	482	Yeah, well, that'll be tough when I announce I've got the head of Pyramid's security with me.
134	19	I'm just saying you live above the club. Aren't you curious?
151	69	The more you humanize yourself in the eyes of your captor, the harder it will be for them to pu the trigger.
131	177	Where are you reading this crap?
142	175	What was that? - Oh, nothing, just part of the process.
147	151	Well, look who it is. That's Miles Vanderwall.
163	548	Polly, can you tell us were Kelly Seymour is?
156	75	My instructions were to be here at 1: 00 and be ready.
162	24	well, he was old and he couldn't move easily.
162	644	Dad, what are you on about?
131	603	I'm going to take "antiques lover from los angeles.
164	557	But on Gaia' Leo, something's different.
147	213	What are you talking about? I didn't leak
112	506	If the Kraken's anything like a colossal squid, it has to live in really deep water, and it needs plenty of food to sustain itself.
153	253	All right, look, let's start at the motel on 9th, then go to Kehl's Self Storage, and then let's hit the surplus store on Palm.
112	457	Welcome to my nightmare. Thank you.
161	387	How am I gonna beat him up with all these kids around?
117	369	So for god sake, would you just stop chopping the carrots?
128	143	Joe, I've known you a long time, but let me tell you something.
132	138	You should make your case in front of the medical board.
125	402	Of getting through your first treatment with strengthand good humor...
125	638	Um, Luc, sweetie, would you get me the salsa?
148	569	If he doesn't...put two bullets in the back of his head.
158	366	Uh－ l think l can help you out.
114	77	just a thank you and a quick reminder:
141	690	Black-bag missions are often broken into separate parts.
151	161	What about the guy with her? Did he say anything?
151	135	And problem is, my wife has heat stroke, and the heat's getting pretty bad here, so...
122	296	oh, wow. Luther, you know, you really need to get some new material.
160	254	Well, Kip is, like, 3 2 years old.
111	359	And at one time, there was more than that, but you know, at my age, you get used to that sort of thing.
141	284	At least now we know how Larry got his information.
127	166	And drop that speech on 'em, 'kay?
129	469	We could be at home making a heart-shaped torte, you know?
142	604	He grilled a mayor's aide for three hours about some mysterious bank account she opened with a Michael Westen.
149	149	Okay. I guess extraction's out of the question. We're just a tad bit out-muscled.
116	411	Okay. Well, help yourself to some mud.
131	662	You said you were a fast reader.
134	106	Of course, if your target turns out to be 13 years old carrying a dismantled pistol, it changes the tactical response somewhat.
134	99	Michael, the guy is sleazy -- - fi.
154	687	I owe it to you and to Nate.
151	85	I like the part about letting Sam go.
136	634	A number and an i. D.
155	1128	So when it comes to getting someone arrested, your job is to get the ball up the field before handing it off to someone who's in a position to put it in the end zone.
129	41	Now I may not have a lot of experience in the workplace, but listening to people's problems, helping them sort themselves out, that I have experience with, that I can do...
158	379	Well, it's, uh－ it's rough, but l got a good feeling, sir. Yeah.
129	537	Are you listening to this? - Listening to what?
156	133	I hope he also told you that my help doesn't come cheap.
158	248	and l'm kind of dead. lt's tough, but not impossible.
152	290	The man is the link to identifying Nate's murderer. We can't screw this up.
136	218	This is what happens -- You're gonna get us out of here because I like miami, and I’m not going back to jail.
142	23	Oh, you remember my partner, detective Lopez.
127	635	No, don't say that. Honey, you saw that line downstairs.
126	749	Yes, isn't it and the funny thing is, she says she knows you very well.
144	622	Get in the kitchen now! What do you want?!
123	294	Your honor, this invalidates the basis of the case.
149	204	This Kamba guy's a first-class monster, even by sub-saharan African standards.
117	475	Okay, you know what, kids? I'm not having fun anymore.
119	338	You know, I'm, um... I really am sorry.
115	733	Thank you for coming. The dinner is over.
112	246	Think of it like the scales of a snake. I just want those
113	499	Lena, you're a miracle. Why would you ever want to be normal?
144	483	You're lucky James Bailey doesn't live in Boca.
151	148	No. We have keys. I was just thanking our friend here for generously donating his truck.
146	350	Carter's showing off the new boat to Wallace right now.
142	252	Thanks for making it easy on me.
123	215	Yeah, it's hard work, isn't it?
128	467	Kevrah for match point. Walker serves.
119	214	Yeah. So I -- I thought we should get together.
116	676	Kitty, everyone who loves you, when they look at you, all they see is you.
128	500	I know that Jake was your friend, but think about it.
162	1568	We've got to make him strong again, Mina.
129	322	And I just want to remind everybody out there that my new book, "moron-proof mothering," comes out next week.
146	439	I guess they can tell themselves he died doing his job.
155	438	You know who Tom Card was to me?!
136	74	Yeah, you know, it's -- It's hard to explain.
122	713	And I think america's looking for somebody who knows the difference, and the only way to do that is by listening, not antagonizing.
140	214	The cops said we had to leave. there's a bomb in the building.
139	402	I didn't. That's part of the problem. She's freaking out, waiting for an answer.
111	157	this doesn't have to limit the rest of Emma's life.
131	67	Her secret is putting butter der the skin.
134	356	I don't know. Like a -- like a plymouthor chevy or something.
118	500	You are up in the polls, and you had a bad day.
145	28	Next time, we're going to the Riviera, not a government training facility.
128	658	Well, I bet you played hard and gave it your all.
145	75	Lots of men don't really focus until it's time to negotiate.
112	99	There he goes. Now he's starting to move.
132	45	It's a box with pieces of a desk in it.
141	169	You need an outlet, you know?
135	577	Come on, fi. Come on, fi.
153	230	No answer? - Still ringing when I hung up.
158	671	So, where were we just, like－ [Chuckles]
142	472	Nothing good. You know, most of Brennen's bank records point to some north African buyer, so, you know, unless you'replanning a trip to Cairo...
129	442	You did that with love, and with your heart, and with your instincts.
114	481	And I wanna make you an offer, Michael.
124	42	I--do we have to do this now? - All right, all right. Okay.
161	17	You look like a lost parent.  - No.
125	597	Do you remember what it was about?
161	696	You're free to sell them to Ghostface Killah.
157	123	I don't do them every day, but i'll see what I can do.
142	276	What's this one here, a. 357? You make this one?
112	311	If the silhouette looks like a whale, similar to how when sharks are underwater and they see surfers, they think it's a seal, right?
155	263	Mike's the only one that had that information, so I guess you have to ask him.
113	991	That's what I told her.  - First thing you do, get rid of him.
129	621	I guess congratulations are in order, which is so totally fine with me.
165	431	This is where the priest said he'd meet up.
132	528	Yeah, it is. It is because you're too young for me.
156	70	This is step one of the operation.
111	309	I'm Detective Britten. This is Detective Bird.
116	409	Uh, we're-- we're gonna do facials, mom, with, uh, mud goop.
141	188	I don't do that, you understand?
153	395	And come on... if anyone can talk Michael Westen down, it's his best friend, right?
132	480	You don't think there are days like yesterday where I don't wish I could give my kids back?
145	181	Hey, you guys need some help? - Yeah, we need some help.
142	109	Simon, my man. Hey, you heading over?
155	684	Hey, I don't feel too good.
164	627	new scientific findings are being made that push the envelope in understanding...
132	1	Yeah, although, she seems more interested in biting her fingernails than she does in talking to us. - Yeah, she was a little nervous.
161	8	Teachers' lounge. They're all the same.
131	551	Are you afraid that I'm gonna embarrass you or - ell, not until now.
145	373	It's not like I haven't been hit before.
145	524	They're circling this area, and they'll find us in minutes and kill us.
152	96	Then the FBI finally caught a break.
117	298	Sarah, stop. Don' no, no, no, Luc.
113	422	So you're 15 and you're a junior?
112	370	When you get the sense of the scale of a ship from up here, and you think of something engulfing it...
131	236	But he... H-he wants to try to change well, then tonight should be fun.
116	579	You must be Justin, the one in medical school.
128	98	Don't expect our family to show up.
115	614	You know, I never liked that girl Lena.
119	156	Was a stupid game. You know, everybody
145	328	No shot. You understand? No shot.
120	487	I don't know what you're - It was a year.
147	59	My pilot flew us here as fast as he could.
115	672	Then why did. Why did you break up?
153	528	Got that bastard. - Exact location?
113	552	Maybe she's using the charm to get to Lena through the boy.
163	275	A remote cabin, an underground bunker, a safe and secure place that only he has access to.
112	542	Let's take a peek at this thing.
124	61	Although he did just wake up from a nap Scotty had just put way too many blankets on him.
137	24	Yeah, well, thanks, but that's not the only reason why I'm here.
124	114	I just need some info on this immigration bill. I'm
128	427	And then there were real-life helicopters.
119	579	Come on by the house. I'll let you borrow one.
159	52	Well, I only meant that... - I know exactly what you meant.
139	69	I think they prefer to call them "timepieces".
115	225	Next time you come by, I want to see that movie. I want to see it really badly.
126	50	But he's shown you who he is
160	480	[ Napoleon's Voice ] There's a lot more where this came from...
147	91	Okay, good,'cause someone's got to keep Tinker Bell here from shooting everyone.
140	226	You can get to a bathroom or closet and make your way out from there.
115	763	It's loud here, but it's the truth, and the truth sets you free.
116	237	Sarah, help if you want to help, but...
116	743	Just, you know, get a new, hot look, go in and just slither right up to him and say, "doctor... " "I need an examination."
145	336	What are they saying? - I don't know. The damn Mikes aren't picking it up.
159	233	What are you talking about, David?
130	497	I didn't... This is totally out of context.
136	421	Greg and bonnie had some plans.
153	247	If it goes live again, I want Westen in surround sound.
160	57	This isn't that complex. Look, the cafeteria's down the hall to the right and downstairs.
155	585	Get those the hell away from me.
120	780	Listen, I know it's...it's difficult for you, too.
152	295	It's time to get our friend drunk, frisky, and compromised.
161	474	So you were just using us to take our money and everything in my house?
164	41	The planet Eronel is an odd planet.
122	337	You called abraham lincoln a homosexual!
137	665	One man watched you, targeted you, burned you?
125	470	Did Kitty get home all right?
153	331	No. I'm gonna end this. I'm turning myself in.
132	178	No, not at all. It's no trouble.
117	744	You have to fix this with Kevin. It's...
161	60	Although five minutes might be four too many.
131	345	Well, I mean, you heard what Jill said. 30, 000 kids.
148	314	No. If we want to keep everyone alive, our only move is to create a distraction and get the hostages out.
148	463	I mean, you hear about these hostage situations.
161	155	Well, I can't really relate to that, but what I would do is just join every club she's in and eventually work up the nerve to talk to her.
140	201	They're evacuating the entire block before they look for it.
142	17	Nate. What are you doing here?
117	502	Let's look at it here. Okay, wait. What's the wireless password?
158	269	Tell Aunt Martha l'm gonna send Bernie with the car to pick you up. Don't forget your homework.
130	118	Maybe it would actually be kind of fun.
136	644	How did you get it all back?
124	443	Well, then this is part of the deal. Now don't worry.
129	315	Okay, um, hi. I’m Nora Walker.
137	1223	The metal on that boat looked pretty worn.
125	615	Well, please make yourself comfortable. I have to go to bed.
137	62	The first step in dealing with a covert op is establishing a way to communicate privately -- a code.
158	457	lf you dwell on all the bad things in life...
142	422	Second story, back door. That's our way in.
165	166	But then the first English flag that we saw was flown by a pack of thieves.
128	230	Got him. Got him. Got him? - You got him. Head shot. Head shot.
126	307	Did you check aisle seven? - I did, and that's what I got.
118	341	It's either rich Kitty Mccallister... Out of touch, spending all this money, or it's poor Kitty Mccallister... Cancer survivor, fragile.
125	555	Aspiring to be normal isn't exactly in my D. N. A.
127	572	I used to be good at this. This used to be easy for me.
153	582	And then there's the fact that you ran.
127	328	No. No, no. Not...not...no. No, no... not... not... not "'kay
116	620	Oh, honey. - Look at my hair.
121	40	You know, I was just reading here in the paper, there's a... a documentary about Leonard Bernstein on public television tonight.
156	368	We'll come down from the roof. - The roof?
148	459	Do you see Marsden over there?
164	607	then the next level of machines, the fishers...
124	679	Really? Okay, go. Eat your waffle. - Yes. Yes, mom.
149	488	When you have a network of gas pipes that run across property lines, a well-placed block of C-4 on a gas main outside the fence can cause an explosive chain reaction inside whatever compound that fence is protecting.
163	657	Yeah, good luck with that. -Thanks.
118	533	What is going on, Robert? - What I'm asking you to do has nothing to do with my health.
129	233	I’m gonna go so you guys can... Have lunch.
126	21	I mean, if Henry's gonna use his family resources,
146	159	It's part of the Nate westen collection. It won't get into my regular rotation. I promise.
117	320	How... How are you? How's it going?
164	316	and then, suddenly, out it snaps.
148	300	Yeah, Holcomb didn't say anything about screwing up, either.
157	63	I just figured you wouldn't leave me twisting in the wind in fort Lauderdale after I risked my ass for you.
125	183	And she helped me through a lot of really tough times when a lot of people labeled me as flaky.
119	64	Well, I actually think it'll go a long way with making my brother feel comfortable with our relationship, personal and professional.
137	184	Well, it's a blackmail thing, and one of the victims got spooked, so she's not saying where she met the bad guy.
123	637	and when they head back down this road...
161	454	I just climbed in the wheel well of a cargo plane, and I flew back to the U. S.
134	608	I saw Erik on the street one night in a -- in a daze.
111	186	It was an awkward situation for all of us.
131	562	You said you were a control freak - oh, for god sake, Nora.
128	354	I'm sorry, Sarah. I think your mom is right.
131	459	But it's quite brilliant, and filled with these wonderful little...
128	619	Yes, he is. And where do i fit in?
145	490	Jesse, they're coming your way. Make it look good.
117	403	And if you don't want to help me, get out of my way.
115	587	You know what? I don't need to impress Isaac.
159	330	I didn't mean to leave him with that impression.
148	521	He got the drop on us.
140	473	N-no, I didn't. They didn't -- they didn't talk to me. I swear. I swear.
124	653	Well, what did you expect? You want to be her father?
132	634	God, how I fantasized about you for years, jonathan.
138	264	He'll be fine. Sam's got family in chicago. He'll be safe there.
128	577	For Kitty, I mean. But you're right.
116	297	look, I'm not advocating your daughter quit chemo.
148	265	See anybody else spiky and blond?
137	1260	From now on, let's make this simple -- make no calls!
146	415	Yeah. That's a funny one, cop.
155	1307	Attention, motor vesselzazu, stop your vessel immediately or we will fire on you.
153	279	Well, whoever Mike's with, they're long gone by now.
119	382	If the guy's a zero, you just, I don't know, pretend there's been a terrible accident, make your excuse and go to the hospital.
163	268	If someone from this town's taken my Brooke, I want to know what the hell's being done about it.
132	576	What if ...She never has a mother again?
152	634	Fi, thank God. We were starting to think you guys were dead.
124	430	Okay, that is a good one. That is a good one.
159	26	I mean, if you could have one thing in the entire world...
153	555	Negative. Target is in the room. Awaiting clean shot.
137	781	You know, I guess they ranout of money in the remodel.
120	65	We're goa impress. Don't worry about it, all right?
118	582	You just will never accept anything from anyone.
141	481	and a hell of a lot more dangerous.
118	295	Okay, I will get a cab. - You're not gonna drive anything.
130	374	Why... why would I put down the bandage?
145	22	I could get used to this new life of yours, Michael.
124	49	We have to get him hydrated. We need to get more fluids into him.
152	695	And whoever took that gun used it to shoot Nate.
151	66	You want to be an active listener, you want to stay positive, and you want to make a connection.
152	732	They were looking to fill the ice-station post in Reykjavik.
150	494	Kind of an unusual gun for this kind of operation, isn't it?
116	213	She did. She thought that it was poisoning her body, and she decided to believe in the power of her own mind, in alternative treatments.
124	304	Oh, my gosh, Kevin. This is like amateur hour.
141	602	So unless you happen to have a fleet of fire-and-rescue vehicles, uniforms, and a dozen actors you trust, you really do have to call 911.
119	621	Bye, Sarah. Good to see you. -- Oh, you're leaving.
156	686	The geeks in the crime lab designed the software.
140	136	What I need is Eddie's books, okay?
153	380	Agent Riley awaiting confirmation of positive I. D. Stand by for further.
161	866	He's a free man!  - Give me a hug!
155	839	You guys should just go, okay?
142	299	That is an international transfer charge.
146	440	Too bad, piggy. Weren't fast enough, huh?
147	38	I was just saying that you better be in a good mood for this boat ride.
154	381	This steel is four inches thick.
153	586	Card was running unauthorized Ops around the globe, and he wasn't going to stop.
123	231	Just have to amputate those two left feet of yours.
146	56	Let's get rid of them and see. That part of your life is over.
164	437	is carbon chemistry in aqueous or water solution.
141	339	I will be here to say..."told you so."
126	534	Do you mind - No, not at all.
156	127	Oh, you must be Fiona Glenanne.
125	75	Well, how much do you think you need?
117	540	What is... What is that? Is that good or bad?
132	672	You are definitely gonna get hit with an excess luggage fee.
124	286	Kevin's decided to take a shower. So...
115	88	Well, mom, the brothers are pretty busy at the moment.
128	799	No, no, look, let me talk, all right?
128	436	These biscotti are amazing. I feel like I'm sitting on a Piazza in Florence.
125	10	I know, but so will my children.
123	19	Look, we'll get those bars installed. - Yeah.
154	394	All right, enough standing around. Let's get out of here.
161	411	What the hell's going on?  - Everything's fine!
113	417	Oh, it's my birthday. I'll be 16.
152	254	I got to find him now.
134	351	They're here. They're outside my office.
120	483	Sarah, this is about you and your issues with sex and getting older.
140	575	So the only way to clear my name is to die a violent death?
153	578	There's more to this, Riley, than you know.
124	354	He told me a couple weeks ago.
154	90	Hey. How are you? Uh, Schmidt sent us.
113	363	Well, she was a lovely woman, your mother.
120	114	Check out the action on this one. I think you'll like it.
147	271	All you got to do is tell them that your car broke down, ask to use the john, toss the doodad in the trash, and split.
123	54	Just because you're staying with your daddy, Paige, doesn't mean you can use that tone with me.
123	186	If an uncomfortable conversation with your ex is too much to ask, well, then, yeah, the politico in me and the girl has to wonder how much faith you have in yourself.
129	190	He-he does stay out late a lot.
126	158	And? - That's it. The light goes on.
146	614	We'll look at these together tomorrow.
146	184	I’m just asking for five minutes, okay?
114	92	Uh, not for sustenance, no, but maybe for appearances every now and then.
144	122	I know when they're gonna cream us and when they're gonna swoop northward and cream somebody else.
150	40	You're not doing this alone. I’m going with you.
141	283	Drew made a copy of Jeannie's datebook.
148	202	I was just explaining to the rent-a-cop here the merits of cooperating.
161	426	You'd better run! I saw your faces!
121	26	He's like that with everybody. - How can I not take it personally?
145	46	But no digital encryption or biometrically locked vaults can keep sensitive information from spilling out of an indiscreet asset's mouth, which is why one of the most common duties for a spy is babysitting.
112	25	So it's this huge, multi-armed creature that could bring down ships.
149	312	The ones who survive are cautious men...
117	230	I... You... You have to understand that... That I have to rearrange everything in my mind, okay?
165	352	All I could think of was finding a way to secure my future.
147	593	Pearce and I had a... debrief at the Agency.
126	31	No, they call them "tweens" now, mom. Tweens.
160	55	[ Woman On P. A.] David Dempke, please come to the office.
113	743	I'm Ridley Duchannes. Follow me.  - You're a relative of Lane's?
126	694	We should implant two embryos, and they should both be yours.
119	78	You know, you really do have loyal... friends.
137	589	I-I can't believe you did this for me.
119	80	I'm sorry, but I -- I really feel like I have to ask this.
118	561	Look at me. Breathe. Just breathe, all right?
161	433	Wade, I think one of them peed in your kitchen.
155	761	The spike of adrenaline, the increased blood pressure, and the loss of any sense of time can make it impossible to think clearly
127	117	Hell-munched?  - Oh, w...no, wait. Wait a minute.
115	688	I am trying to save my marriage. Lena was a mistake. I know.
128	487	No, I know. And, Justin, obviously, if you don't like it, we're not…we're not gonna buy it.
131	691	I don't know how we're supposed to choose.
154	243	Vanek can't actually get in here.
115	219	The dress was the only reason we got in.
124	193	You know what? It doesn't really matter because we're gonna have to redo it all anyway after the shower.
151	289	Help me fill out this report. You got your Level Five?
124	311	Well, you have your pills, right?
132	191	My nephew had some things he wanted to donate, so I brought them in, and I figured I'd answer the phone while I was here.
145	90	Jesse, I want to help, but your timing -- right this minute -- couldn't be worse.
117	604	You remember, you used to hold me like this and you would tell me that you would always be there for me?
161	165	Rule 35A in the teacher's manual states that you cannot date other teachers.
113	527	You could have made a ladder, you know.
136	62	Mom, are there any empty houses in the neighborhood within, say, hmm, 350 meters?
152	108	That your witness? - Yeah. Yeah.
135	678	Well, she's smart. She won't be returninganytime soon.
135	554	No, I'm talking about the guy, milovan. He's a foreigner. He talks like this.
146	209	You don't like him, you don't like him.
142	347	Look at your car! It's in the middle of the street! Look at it!
122	687	Oh, sweetie, Joe is not old, and that marriage was already beyond repair.
117	380	Oh, god. You... You don't think she...
145	400	Mike, uh, it's probably best if you stay here, keep an eye on Takeda.
122	616	Well, don't tell the good citizens of iowa, but I'd much rather be here with you.
124	5	I mean, I-I certainly can't work with people that I wrote a book about.
144	605	I'd try to take out the competition, too...
116	166	Dad, I'm really sorry about mom.
113	702	More energy is gonna be released than ever before and this Earth's cycle will be over.
154	518	Fi, we are not handing him over to be killed.
140	173	Traffic is brutal this time of day.
120	709	Uh, I don't know where Justin is.
122	215	Becca, I got fired from a coffee shop.
152	147	jess. You guys were there for me when I needed it.
121	264	Honey, you know Dr. Karl, at the station?
154	690	Hey, mom, will you give me a minute alone? I'll be right behind you.
119	104	It's that insufferable Miranda Jones and her husband.
161	784	Yeah. -You just get that burst of strength.
132	636	Till they kicked me out because I was - because you were a drunk, yes, I know. And such a cute drunk you were.
158	349	That's cool. l'm a loser too.
162	387	There is something wrong. I should never have listened to you. You and your big ideas.
115	260	Mom's really into this guy Isaac, okay?
134	197	Honest, I heard the situation, and I insisted.
126	566	Do you mind if I join you
155	982	I'm getting the sense that you don't trust me.
121	550	So when you tried to kiss me, I was surprised for a moment, and... and then when I got my wits about me, y... you'd run away.
125	48	I'll come get you around 6: 00.
149	353	Okay, Mike. Here's the deal. We couldn't get the guns in.
121	100	Just a... a girl in accounting was wondering.
162	230	what is it with grapes and hospitals?
113	550	Ethan had some kind of charm. It had a Duchannes power in it.
146	459	Let me find out what the feds know about me.
113	1062	paralyzed, and damn near killed by your family.
132	469	You're trying to drive me crazy so that I'll go screaming to new york.
129	661	Kevin... I - think we should foster.
146	206	Chief, it's not like that. I thought I had an opportunity here.
112	449	That is a fantastic, fantastic specimen.
114	212	I'm a nurse over at SCH. I'm here all the time.
137	542	It's the black jeep over there.
112	95	He's clamped his suckers right onto the tank and will not budge.
158	626	l have to sort things out. Give me a hug, you.
137	446	Your cut is 10 grand a shipment.
151	436	Psycho woman over there in the truck, she decides when we go boom.
156	54	I made arrangements with Fiona Glenanne to support you on this, so tell Sonya...
156	372	And how are you planning on getting one of those?
127	318	We're gonna have to cancel.  - Are you kiddin'?
158	56	Heart attack! l know C.P.R! l'm not having－
111	375	North of ten million. Ten million?...
118	399	A person can live a long, healthy life these days.
164	232	AG-143 orbits a bright F-class star.
161	308	Hey, how's it going, Drillbit?  - Hey, Drillbit.
161	490	No, you said you were a doctor. You're a doctor. You're not a doctor?
162	1319	I used to come here all the time when I needed to think.
134	344	With today's powerful encryption, it's usually a waste of time trying to decipher coded communication.
141	586	He's no Campbell, though. - Who is?
164	347	It's borderline for an Earth-like planet.
148	214	And in exchange for a job well done, you will receive two things...
124	553	just wait a minute. just. What am I missing?
148	29	In any search-and-capture operation, you have to balance speed against planning.
133	415	He can't talk if he can't breathe, fi.
147	360	Yes, sir. - I said,"Is that understood"?
121	27	He called my show "Ask madam Mao".
159	329	and you blew him off? What...
128	401	Just out. - What? No, no, no, no, no.
121	445	Nora, Nora, please. Please. - No, no, no. Nora, Nora, no, no, no. Please, please. Come on.
125	310	I just--I just didn't have the heart to tell them that their aunt Kitty is so sick.
151	309	Hi. Welcome to Swamp Hawks. Y'all have an appointment?
131	89	Okay, now have a seat in our living room.
163	298	Where's my daughter, you son of a bitch?
123	443	You're gonna go see her. - Ye, I am. Look around, robert.
152	497	This is bad, is what this is.
116	662	There are models who eat fried chicken every day, and they still lose weight.
115	478	I can't believe we have to actually be here for her dates now.
149	98	You think the best option is sending in the burned spy.
142	607	I assume you were trying to get to me.
142	193	I want to know who his buyer is, where he's got Nate, - what brand of orange juice he drinks in the morning. - I'm on it.
116	499	You know, I just think she's feeling a little vulnerable.
130	587	Do you want to come over? - Open the door.
134	550	We got a problem. Quinn got to Erik before he could run.
155	497	There's a way out of this -- Doesn't involve more bloodshed.
113	1037	No, ma'am. I... I don't think so.
150	245	You were with the counterintelligence field activity agency, right?
132	52	No problem. I'd be happy to, except I'm not volunteering there anymore.
123	571	I've got two minutes till the end of my auction, and I'm afraid gopgirl's gonna snipe my ronald reagan bobblehead.
147	89	I'll do it, Mike, but you're gonna buy me every mojito I can drink for a month.
155	1033	I get to lie in a bed.
153	463	Receiver's got a 5- amp relay. Range can't be more than 350 meters.
160	534	Pedro, how do you feel about that one?
119	162	Well, you know, Sarah, no, I honestly don't recall.
128	39	What? I can't understand your accent.
125	550	Valentine's day. You'd never been in a helicopter.
136	106	Oh, I’m not very good at that sort of thing.
145	268	I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to, Fi.
146	208	Vic, take this guy back. Work on his manners.
163	555	I was captain of the varsity soccer team my senior year.
150	318	Hey, Michael. Looks like you just got some bad news.
136	420	I don't know -I got bank statements, plane tickets, huh?
123	322	You refused to talk about anything except your career, when you were even here, which was rarely.
164	247	would also develop other physical characteristics...
155	143	Okay. and, uh, why is that one special?
127	501	Is that Buffy?  - Yes, it is.
148	438	Uh, Sam, I think I know how the cops found us.
154	659	Yeah, no kidding. I'm -- I'm -- I'm gonna, uh, blow this hellhole tonight.
136	8	A trigger-Happy  ex-Girlfriend... -should we shoot them?
128	424	You fly space ships and shoot bad guys, just like uncle Justin did in the war.
132	371	I mean it. But thank you.
116	582	Great if you're up for memorizing a thousand different diseases that start with a stomachache.
137	1111	You sure you don't want me to stay?
151	346	How many is it, huh? - Shut up! I said shut up!
115	128	You know, a very standard "I'm sorry we broke up, you know, I still care about you" e-mail.
160	370	I'm goin'to Adams Park. They got some money in Adams Park.
161	77	I will.  - You know?
134	384	That means it can only get off two shots at a time.
154	266	Uh, does it involve hitchhiking? Because our ride is back there with the bad guys.
164	496	and we don't think life could exist on these worlds.
112	498	So what I think happens is our Kraken grabs hold of it,
151	552	You protect your head, do your best to stay on your feet, and, most of all, you hope for a miracle.
147	58	I was just finishing up some business in Rio when you called.
153	394	There's no need for bloodshed here.
154	104	You have any idea how much business that little bastard has cost me over the years?
145	120	Well, I might have a lead on our needle.
115	627	We had a lab, didn't we, Tommy?
121	546	I... I hope you can just forget about that stupid move of mine in there.
130	252	She... this... this... it just came out wrong.
113	1035	and you being motherless and all.
152	207	I got to get a message to Quinn.
130	121	My brain is mush. - Okay. Good, good.
137	301	Cowan gets the gold star for clever, doesn't he?
146	144	I mean, Nate's friend isn't just dealing with a street hustler here.
159	145	masking conservative support of big business...
161	150	Things are already just crazy hot, just loco.
152	79	I asked him questions with a gun in my hand - a gun I have the right to legally carry.
140	39	You learn about people when you make them play defense -- their reflexes, weaknesses, how they handle themselves under pressure.
145	155	Oh, like your wife is any different.
131	582	They're all so cute. Why are they so cute?
129	665	I I guess I-I’m not, um, ready for this.
115	129	He e-mails back a very unstandard,"I'm coming home.
113	168	I'm Ethan Wate, by the way.
155	129	Thing is, we have ourselves a bit of a situation.
115	218	Wait. My mother went to studio 54 in a viking dress?
133	443	Oh, honey, i've met guys like this before.
160	90	Tonight me and your aunt are gonna go visit some friends...
145	95	You're the one that's always been about helping people, right?
148	513	They're less expensive and considerably more flammable than natural fibers, making them the tie of choice to ignite a gas tank.
152	172	And you can't change that. I'll wait for you outside.
132	225	Maybe. He was wearing a jersey.
141	513	He -- he just showed upand told me that the job was on. I tried to tell him
148	396	If you need to redirect an airplane mid-flight and you can't get to the airport, your best bet is probably the local TRACON relay station.
162	1635	That can't just be it! You can't just give up!
144	435	Cole traced their cell calls to a neighborhood, so now he's got to hunt for the house.
112	472	Look at that. That is absolutely barm.
131	347	You know there are, still two guys out there with cameras?
122	43	Oh! Oh, gosh! He's coming home. Justin's coming home.
137	337	Rod bucksey, green beret. I got out in '97.
160	236	No, go find your own. - Come on. Give me some of your Tots.
154	547	you give Schmidt up and I will get you out of the country myself.
122	466	By the way, mom, they're tommy's favorites, not mine.
128	2	Oh, come on, mom. We're only here for three days. We're not waiting out the apocalypse.
115	565	That was. That was plainly on the table. -Okay, but the timing is less than perfect.
137	508	But you wait and you watch and you stay alert, because, at any minute, the job can get way too exciting.
111	377	The problem is, Maya King, Pearl, the other senior residents they were all there before he bought the place. They were on rent control.
159	18	They are a short walk from here.
132	640	The world did not make it easy for us.
117	664	I - I unpacked them all. Everything is back where it was.
116	313	I'm glad you came. - Yeah, me, too.
140	651	Why'd -- why'd you have to go to the fbi?
154	677	If the CIA were here, they'd have moved in already.
118	427	What do they have you taking these days?
114	188	I did this? - You did this.
159	478	Are you sure you want to mess with this?
114	142	They order coffee, but then they just sit there and never even touch it.
152	256	Who are you? And what just happened?
159	42	and then I want to come back here and fuck.
115	886	In light of this, and after consultation with my family and staff,
131	31	Annie, I'm sorry.   - It's-no, it's fine. I'm not-you know what?
130	56	It's to publicize my show,"dear mom,"surrounded with her loving daughters, so be here at 4: 00.
149	410	Maddy. - Hey. What are you doing here?
137	155	In 20 years, Michael, I have never asked any questions.
146	196	I can get us papers that make that boat yours.
112	144	This eyewitness account of a giant squid is extremely rare.
129	331	Luc, hello? Can you hear me?
155	104	He looked at the board, and he realized he might be running out of moves and this might be the best option.
150	260	I work with some very well-financed individuals who are curious about your country's counterintelligence activity.
130	220	Wait. Kitty, are you saying that you actually want to run this with me?
122	14	Justin's unit was returning to the base, and they hit an I. E.D.
132	198	And then we grounded her for the rest of the night.
154	193	Okay, this sucks! - Let's go!
124	406	There you are. Are you with Justin?
163	511	It may be something you're not even aware of, or you may have forgotten
162	257	He wrote poems and painted pictures.
114	2	Do what? Be a better monster?
144	462	How fast can you pick up Fi and get over to 2nd Avenue?
123	82	They want to talk about health care, jobs, the war, why it's 72 degrees in Iowa in the middle of October. Right?
128	204	You know, I got roped into playing this doubles tournament. So I figured i'd go and hit with the pro.
164	597	sophisticated software could give these beings...
117	148	And then what? Holly, that's probably all that we need.
159	389	Unless we take advantage of what their position in life has to offer by way of an opportunity.
132	358	No, I'm - I'm - I'm sorry.
147	239	What do you suggest we do -- take on 50 guys with our handguns?
126	40	No. Mom, he dropped off the face of the earth for six weeks
123	494	Well, I'm really happy for you...
161	747	I can't breathe! I can't breathe!  - You're not gonna hurt me anymore?
145	236	Any shipments that come through here are mine.
155	592	You going to be able to run this trace?
154	538	I'm the one who's got you surrounded and outgunned, - so I get to do the talking. - Then talk.
130	481	If you're gonna be mad at somebody, Sarah, just be mad at me.
141	447	But I got through to one guy, and then I couldn't get through
118	165	But I also told you, if it got anywhere near her, I was out.
148	481	Uh, you just seem like the type, honey.
140	281	I threw in some vague boston mob connections just for good measure.
122	121	Uh, interviews, uh, after which we go to des moines for a tarmac rally.
125	403	Of you and your white blood cells fighting the good fight...
163	508	Probably won't be a casual acquaintance.
153	35	Gray shot your brother. He murdered Nate.
126	483	We want the robot to dance longer. - To dance longer?
115	591	Yeah, she does, and if he breaks her heart, i'll sue him.
145	247	Move! Let's go! I said "move"!
129	416	Well, you know what? There's a lot more to me than this.
112	492	So I think the Kraken is going to use the3e hooks to hang on.
137	481	Happens all the time. Don't worry about it.
146	501	Wait a minute. You're the guy who crashed into me.
114	487	Just keeping the streets of Boston safe for all the little children.
150	49	He agrees... Or he doesn't walk away.
140	436	Yeah, you have been spreading yourself kind of thin lately.
152	561	We got Duke. He's at North Miami General, just like Robbie said.
149	13	… If you're desperate. Someone needs your help, Michael.
115	423	You keep saying he's a republican. I'm far more impressed she might be dating a black man.
155	1355	I did what I -- what you had to do.
129	365	And what kind of pie is this?
152	248	I sure hope your boy Michael knows what the hell he's doing.
118	257	Now I'm gonna turn this light right here...
121	362	Oh! Okay. That's a relief. - Yeah.
125	705	I-is this okay? Does it hurt?
116	613	I'll be-- I'll be out in a minute.
164	633	and more alien faces than anyone could ever imagine.
162	935	Er... the man who lived here was...
161	32	Teacher. Teacher and a doctor. Just want to help.
123	466	So you decided that... - that is not true, Julia.
127	525	All right, in we go.  - Okay.
155	516	We're not doing a prisoner exchange.
118	61	All right. No more pizza. You're done.
148	625	I'm putting Marsden in the ground right now.
162	140	And you're the closest thing I've got to a neighbour.
153	189	Any more questions? - Yeah, just one.
155	28	As soon as we get some place safe, we're going to sit down and figure out a way to fix all of this.
129	238	Okay. - You know the drill?
132	329	I guess she picked my pocket when she hugged me.
140	42	My guess is you'll tap out in a minute, maybe two.
117	354	How's that? Mom, put down the knife.
132	655	I don't know. I stole money from you.
125	91	Uh, you see, we actually met with a surrogacy agency, and you would not believe how much they charge.
147	409	If you know which employees will be out of town, you can send a care package filled with metallic sodium to an empty office.
146	64	If a shopper behind you is carrying a suspicious package and avoiding eye contact, they could be there to do you harm.
163	381	Don Haas has an alibi for the night your daughter was taken.
159	245	and scores his big chance to fuck his way to Washington"?
155	819	Later, when you're dealing with the consequences, the only thing you can do is wait and hope.
150	15	Use burned spies to carry out ops that legitimate intelligence agencies wouldn't touch.
146	231	That's why we're going to do more than just get you mixed up with a police investigation.
131	186	He looks like the sixth member of 'nsync.
113	150	No cure yet, huh?  - We continue to research and hope.
115	92	I'm just saying, why do we all have to be there?
144	200	Just need to put Harris and Lane on the right track, then you can go... Hunker down?
115	198	As long as we keep the doors locked.
145	234	I need to know where those sweet little Asian girls are, 'cause let me tell you something
161	507	I tell you what, I'll give you 1, 500 for everything.
142	425	Yeah, that move only works before you're in a choke hold. Just relax.
136	529	One wire transfer -- It's done, and then we can go on with our business.
142	577	You know, I really thought I had something this time.
142	171	Add a few pencils for legs, and you've got a cute little improvised hacking device.
113	1105	A curse this dark takes its time showing itself. The Dark will test you.
139	436	Something that says, "I love you, but I can't marry you".
113	1057	Please, son, for your own good.
152	193	You trust me. It will be different this time.
124	664	Oh, god. You, too? I am an overbearing mother.
147	519	...You let a mysterious super-genius take over your island, turn your op inside out, and detain your commander's men.
160	56	David Dempke. - [ Man ] You do understand English?
134	614	You -- you said there were killers.
146	54	Vaughn, Carla, management they don't deserve a place in your head or your file cabinet.
155	581	Michael and I have a plan for dean.
134	216	But we need to keep Quinnon the sidelines.
154	153	I already apologized a thousand times, okay?
117	670	No, Luc, you cannot get on a plane with a one-way ticket and no luggage.
131	654	Well, I know there's only so many hours in a day, Justin.
148	478	It's all right. I'm here to help. I'm one of the good guys.
160	481	if you go to the dance with me.
137	587	We're going to take that evidence, go to Kent, get him to shut down his little operation, and have him back off.
118	7	Look, when you're in your 60s, you don't sleep, ever.
130	172	Uh, no, actually, uh, grandma took me. - Grandma?
146	203	You worked with a crew in Vegas? - crew? No.
145	314	Of course, some friendships are friendlier than others.
123	280	What was his demeanor? - A lot of catty back talk.
125	528	You look so beautiful in that dress, it's almost a shame to waste it on just me.
120	74	You can--you can buy anything you want under $40.
144	501	What, saving your life didn't buy me some hands-free time?
154	470	I'll call you as soon as we need pickup.
145	290	Her idea of a fun time is having a conversation about gardening or h-home decor.
148	35	The guy just tried to mow us down with a high-caliber machine gun, Mike.
111	409	So, I went to the U. S. Marshals, got a subpoena. Turn out, they're the only two calls ever made from that phone, and they were both made from this building...
141	245	So, it looks like our buddy Bill had a hell of a career in the marines.
113	217	The town shut-in with a mysterious past.
113	1101	Did Macon look through it?  - No, he couldn't.
121	625	You should talk to Kimberly and Angie and mom. - I did already.
161	679	Five. In the back. In the back.
156	148	We could start by approaching him.
130	165	I don't want to get into this now. - Okay. Well, when do you?
131	427	Sure. Are--are you okay? - My shoulder--it's from the seat belt. It's okay.
125	171	Well, you gotta trust me on this one.
116	726	This is worth a lot, Kevin.
160	430	Now, if you invest in the 2 4-piece set...
132	422	You are grounded for a week.
130	50	Well, it's after 10: 00 in the morning. What are you guys doing there?
135	383	most interrogation subjects are already scared.
125	558	But here's the thing--at the end of the day, all that power...
117	222	Just tell me that you're not gonna be in the middle east.
130	239	And she kept on saying,"oh, you're on your way to accomplishing so much, and business is Sarah's thing,"and blah, blah, blah.
137	671	You'd do the same in my position.
121	5	Mnh-mnh. - You're not holding a cake.
115	117	I don't, no. All right. -We will all be there with bells on.
125	525	It is gonna take us months or even years to get out from under the debt that Tommy put us in.
115	327	Why are you laughing? I didn't.
141	147	We worked togetherin the balkans -- '91, '92.
151	219	I do love winning, but it's less fun if you aren't paying enough attention to notice.
131	602	Uh, we have time for one more caller.
152	559	The question is whether it's Duke or your girl.
164	456	of what we think organisms can do and what we know organisms can do.
140	707	It'll also stop a car pretty well.
160	35	Hey, could I use your guys's phone for a second?
124	126	You know what? I'll do it.
157	113	You know, the metal barfor taking out the nails?
145	283	Maybe we should... ...venture out after all.
158	384	l BlackBerried you. l don't have a BlackBerry.
163	295	Now, I know that we're all upset about Polly and Brooke and Kelly, but it is important that we keep a positive attitude.
128	205	Why don't you ask this pro standing right here?
160	369	See, Crystal Street. That's for you.
118	321	That would be the mother of two. Excuse me.
124	628	In case you missed it, the last time I lived alone, I,uh, I O. D.'D.
137	1009	In a hostage situation, you have to be cruel to be kind.
153	161	Well, look, I'm just glad Norm's gonna be okay.
119	634	They're too tied up with their little personal problems.
161	202	Got the munchies?  - Anyways, we just worry about you.
120	489	You're refusing to try online dating... - Well, that's revolting.
144	737	I'm supposed to meet Vaughn this afternoon.
128	414	Fine by me. - Works for me.
117	628	He...Never knew who he was, and you were so there and on the surface, so ready, willing and wanting to know yourself.
152	473	Looks like it's the next block on the right.
150	197	This was supposed to be the best team. - It wasn't the team's fault.
163	330	Mind if I smoke? - Yes.
164	295	it begins pulling the water up like it's pulling it up a well...
162	1172	A lot of the time he lived nude.
140	9	Carla wanted to leave a harder clue for the crossword.
127	39	I haven't seen him in weeks.  - Oh. Good. Well, I... I...
165	103	Thank god my father's lived to see this day.
112	20	Let's have a look at the legend.
119	603	So I think I'm gonna go.
158	167	Hey, sweetie. You, uh, scamper up that ladder and－ and fix that light.
152	315	And no matter what a salesman has going on...
158	83	Yes. A massage that l won at a charity raffle.[Man] Shut up.
146	510	Then let's put it back together.
111	246	You didn't seem as certain as your parents about giving up this baby, and I want to be sure that you're doing this for you, because you want to and not because they want you to.
153	619	And now you want to stay.
124	259	you-- I mean, you know Coop. He was playing to his audience.
128	362	look at us... a couple of men of leisure hitting some tennis balls on a Saturday afternoon.
158	188	ls that toothpaste? Yeah. lt's an ancient Chinese remedy for burned fingers.
125	653	Uh, grandma, um, where's aunt Kitty? We want to give her our present.
158	520	Hey. Has anyone seen Harry? [All] No.
158	121	Look. Where you are right now, l've been there.
123	338	I would rather spend all eternity at a dinner party seated next to britney spears than waste an afternoon lugging clubs around a bunch of overfed, over privileged arnold palmer wannabes, but for you, I'll swallow it.
127	438	I mean, I... I'm just unhappy to hear that you're so miserable.
121	103	Oh, mom, I gotta go. I got a notary here. - Sarah. Sarah, never mind.
120	567	I asked you that because I didn't even know how to talk to a woman like you.
128	201	No. I'm gonna wait till the sun goes down.
145	478	I can. - You'll do as I tell you!!
115	56	This campaign has been runnin' on fumes for the past two weeks.
130	613	No. - No, I'm serious. Just look me in the eye...
152	28	But when you need a simple answer to a straightforward question,that same bureaucrat can become your worst enemy.
122	250	Harpy? He called me "harpy"? I can't believe this.
113	287	Yeah, I've read it twice before.
140	737	I found them in your pants.
118	386	Right. - The answer is yes.
119	736	But, you know, to be fair, they're fantastic in a crisis.
145	572	It made us who we are.
127	10	Mm. Of all the galleries in all the towns in all the world...
135	73	same card bought gas three times in a neighborhood in doral.
164	274	so you can do things with more energy.
119	308	like, you all get together, solve problems
112	331	I'm sure it could get a lot worse but it could be
113	1079	The whole country. Gatlin is like the capital of Caster America.
131	415	Obviously, I'm too much of a control freak to have, uh, had my own children, so... The least I can do is to learn to be friends with yours.
122	708	Look, I don't share many of my future mother-in-law's views either, but she's not unpatriotic, and she's certainly not treasonous-- your words.
129	29	Nothing? Who were you talking to?
155	983	I'm not trusting many people these days.
129	38	Why do they want you again?
142	438	We'll check for any addresseswe might have missed. We're gonna find him.
136	225	You want to take that thing out of my ribs now?
129	642	Have you asked 'em? - No, I have not.
145	321	I feel it'd be irresponsible of me to hand that over to you without a consult.
164	228	The laws of physics don't change as you travel through the universe...
153	208	Maybe they know something. - Forget it.
125	202	I'm not gonna need to know how to do this, all right?
126	773	God. Mom, that was like-- that was incredible.
142	135	Once your pretty little hands swipe that card...
112	43	Jim Cosgrove is a renowned octopus researcher.
118	471	Do you have any idea what you're asking of me? Do you?
152	399	Especially if they have a little fire to deal with.
164	544	and a tentacle whips out and grabs it and pulls it right in.
118	488	It's just pushing my buttons is all.
152	97	They tracked down Quinn's right-hand man, James "Jimmy Boy" Leary, right here in Miami.
131	629	So... You think we should just break up? - yes.
122	448	You guys here to take me home or what?
118	481	Isn't that what you said, you go every year?
147	568	Lovely evening for an arms deal.
131	144	that's because I am 16 in that picture.
117	423	Mr. York. Hi, I'm Kevin walker.
121	675	Well, on the other hand, she's also very strong, single-minded, resourceful.
148	251	Next. - Is to actually be helpful.
155	1111	I liked it better when the plan was to go... get away from this.
155	1157	Then you better start holding up your end of the bargain, and that means Westen's head on a plate.
141	532	It'll be a little out of your comfort zone, but we'll keep you safe, okay?
153	275	Mike, I will leave you here. I'm not playing right now.
124	165	You mean the one that feeds the labor force that drives the California economy?
158	20	No, no, no. There. She's－ She's with me.
126	344	Ugh. This is a bad mistake. - Decisions about what? Fill me in. What's going on?
122	244	I have a stack  of letters to the editor  this woman has written
113	1297	Sacrifice won't take away the pain of loss.
126	779	I called Saul to come here in case there was trouble.
144	732	But you and Vaughn are at odds, and now Simon is involved.
161	157	Okay, look. One should do the opposite.
117	238	Hello, brothers. Wow, look at our little Justin.
117	197	If Kevin comes, we'll have a feast.
127	732	No, I'm not gonna change my mind. I'm not...
141	43	They must be using him for something big.
163	296	Those girls, they'd want you to be strong.
164	421	Creatures like the swaystacks and the lollygars...
121	170	Look, I'll get my luggage - and take a taxi back to the hotel. - Hotel?
147	63	Of course I can. You know me -- always a friend to those in need.
130	42	We are all here for you. - You know what?
137	775	They might have a job they want me to do.
142	490	Well, it's Fi, Mike. You got to ask?
147	553	Disarming people by force is bloody and unpleasant.
113	1303	Oh, my sugar darling? He's ready to go whenever I call.
125	185	I feel like this is another case of my opinion not mattering as much as yours does would you mind not taking a text message while I'm talking to you?
148	453	But just to remind you, um, I'm sending out a "Come and get me" signal.
138	207	Tell me what you see, fiona.
129	398	Kitty, I-I didn't mean to push you.- I ca-I can't do this.
126	205	And that was a-a bad call.
125	138	I just--I-I feel so much better.
134	486	The sooner april and her boys don't have to worry about Luna, the better.
144	35	I'm trying to get a face-to-face with Simon.
132	418	You were trying to hide it from them and from me.
115	616	No, she's a home wrecker. She's just like holly.
111	600	He was so drunk by the end, he would've cried if I told hi I liked his hair.
136	353	I talked to greg and bonnie. -Enough about greg and bonnie.
136	631	But you make sure the feds follow you.
140	348	Are you in? Are you gonna be in?
163	598	Blew his knee out in the first quarter of the championship.
125	426	Yeah, I agree. - Oh, no, no, no.
142	313	Brennen placed a bunch of calls to Hamstead bank and trust.
123	309	Yeah. Good luck getting that past general walker.
117	464	Me walking outta here with my tail between my legs after handing you the key to a fortune...
145	585	Improvisational jazz -- I kind of figured it was your style.
116	380	You're right. You're right. I-I look like-- like a giant tomato.
163	179	Kidnappers. Are we sure they just haven't run off?
158	351	Oh. You just haven't had any good luck. That's all.
148	104	It's a --it's a corporate-security gig.
124	138	I--I went to, uh, I-Iraq and Afghanistan.
145	366	He's gonna yell, push you around, probably tear your blouse.
126	657	Why don't you come over for lunch
120	322	Oh, it's a family thing, is it, making up excuses?
161	320	They're wingtips.  - you look like you teach Fagonometry.
121	123	Oh, no, no, no, no. You don't have to do that. You know what?
145	126	Not for long. Let's hope Mike hurries up with his CIA job.
113	745	Uh, oh, this is my friend Link.  - Sincere pleasure, Link.
155	248	I always want to call them plantains, but that's ridiculous 'cause that's like a Cuban bane, right?
128	344	You never minded when Tommy was playing with "duck hunt.
162	390	You did it for you. So you could be the big man in the big house! What was I thinking?
136	440	If Quentin leaves the boat, our plan is in serious trouble.
147	235	The base is here, airstrip's right here, satellite uplink is way over here, and the hard asses with the M4s, they're kind of... Everywhere.
153	355	Yes. Uh, h- he called, uh, just a while ago.
113	1401	She told me you were going Dark anyway. I would never hurt you.
117	697	I mean, I don't want to think about what we didn't get.
140	262	Promise nothing will happen to him maybe I can do $3, 000.
142	176	Barry, you're gonna have to start bringing the second man to this two-man job.
147	472	Detain Jackson's men until you hear from me. That's an order.
131	65	And then we can watch your show if it means so much to you.
151	370	I made the call. You'll get your package.
147	332	Now, then, who are you? - We work internal security for the Pyramid Group.
119	264	She's -- she's -- she's seeing a senator -- the senator -- McCallister.
157	180	I can point you to some top flight people. But you know what?
122	279	Um, no. Sarah, I took it off a month ago.
126	387	I'm sorry. Wart are you  talking about? You're in medical school.
118	172	I hope you have a safe place to hide them.
150	358	Ryan, nick, and I will cover the tarmac with m4s while Rebecca picks us up.
122	44	Kitty, Kitty, bye! - Bye. Bye, Kitty.
148	449	I'll call in a favor with my cop buddy, see what we can work out?
142	482	Yeah, no kidding. There's no business records, either, for Belle Anna.
155	109	We're leaving, starting over some place new.
161	51	What are we doing? Let's go.  - I don't know.
161	630	Why do you even waste my time? You're pathetic.
156	676	Yeah, we're talking extortion, a little wire fraud, racketeering.
146	448	When people are whipped into a murderous frenzy, standing between them and their target can get you killed.
130	24	Guys, I told you. I do not want you calling him.
161	21	You know French?  - A little bit. Yeah.
137	843	See, me, I'm an ex-green beret.
113	1390	I think this is just between you and me, Mama.
122	552	Don't worry. I'm not gonna put any pressure on my knee.
145	143	I don't see a wedding ring on that finger. My advice -- keep it that way.
136	178	Would you put some pants on?
124	167	I've missed this. - Me, too.
155	668	This is the only way to do this without bloodshed.
155	790	Yeah, 9mm, close range through a car door.
119	212	Uh, listen, I know we got off to a rocky start with our, um...
140	91	Well, actually, I think it's time to upgrade.
130	401	Why is that? - Okay, because...
154	23	I need a little favor, Dixon.
145	348	He -- he asked for -- for -- for water.
113	837	Pay no mind to her lies.  - You know it's true.
164	215	there are two factors that we scientists zero in on.
149	234	Fine. But, Michael, go talk to your mom.
163	252	He did not do all this work to simply kill the girls once he had them.
134	94	It's a little more complicated than that, fi.
128	505	There you go. - Okay, when I say "we are," you say "champions.
111	440	You have any kind of proof that he made contact with you?
123	425	I am still dirt poor, but I have been putting myself through chef school in pasadena.
145	175	All right, end of the line, pal. Just drop your
112	516	The strong currents make it way too dangerous for diving, so the best way to see the sea life, the food our Kraken might eat, is from the air.
131	51	What, am I dating the Robert Redford of psychiatry?
149	28	Break into a defense contractor? I didn't say it was gonna be easy.
136	575	Don't take too long and don't go anywhere.
114	512	I'm not turning into it in the hospital anymore.
146	524	Well, you got a better idea, Trey?
123	177	Just...just draw that line in the sand.
162	283	There must be some other sick soul you can inflict yourself on.
134	87	You don't even know this Strickler.
153	515	...less than 10 minutes before they sweep.
129	509	Where is mom? She-she's not at home.
131	133	The huffington post?   -  What do you mean, it's all over the internet?
163	86	We'll be back Friday night. Love you, bye.
164	622	the fishers could dismantle the sphere...
151	347	You think you know me? You don't know anything.
126	263	I'm getting real tired of it. See you, Dennis.
161	312	Drillbit! Drillbit.  - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
145	109	And you think she's here in Miami?
116	694	It's not too puffy. It's not too...
163	510	Don't just think people you've knowingly wronged.
137	374	As much fun as it is hanging out with you, this little stakeout's costing me a fortune.
125	14	And I don't think it'd be right for them to, you know, come home from Europe  after being there for months, to find me shacked up with a...
112	12	Now a team of investigators will track down clues and find evidence for the beast behind the legend.
160	401	That was the one. I think that's gonna come out really nice.
154	380	What's the hold up? I want this door open.
127	309	Yeah, is everything all right? Have you... have you gotten rid of that whole ridiculous green card marriage thing?
152	604	Get me Dylan and Shane on the phone.
123	252	When you're off the crutches, then you can do the dishes, not that you've ever done them before. So just go and lie down.
113	342	ran my fingers across the ivories?
156	516	Uh，oh, looks like someone's going on a road trip.
115	50	We'll just keep scheduling television appearances and make sure that everybody hears your side of the story.
151	106	They do contract hits to pass the time. Same way some girls knit.
146	515	You up for giving him a little help?
161	608	Do you see Filkins?  - No, but I see Brooke.
125	101	And there's a year-long waiting list.
147	46	Like taking Fiona here out more often. A woman needs to be appreciated, Michael.
137	332	Nice phone. What is that -- the razr?
165	264	I know I should be worried about my affairs at home, but at the moment, I'm just grateful for my life.
155	53	And what do I get in return, exactly?
152	246	Well, it looks like we got a pretty big party started.
146	580	Hey, Mike, I need to talk to you for a minute.
164	329	As we end our examination of the food chain on AG-143...
147	57	Fiona, it's so good to see you.
151	322	As any crisis negotiator knows, only about one in five hostages survives a rescue attempt.
137	1258	I need that phone right now.
141	193	Usually with a job like this...
130	290	This is really not a good time.
122	663	Mom, did you know that there's a lincoln highway in iowa?
147	284	Not an angel... But nobody who'd done any harm to me. I-I didn't know until after.
155	504	We can't secure a hand off.
148	445	Okay, look, I'm sorry. M-maybe this is fixable.
126	386	And I might have learned something If you and everybody else in this family didn't do everything for me.
137	515	Can I call you back, Fi?
113	439	My father always said trouble follows that family like stink on a fly's ass.
112	407	But the feet or, you know, the arms, as we usually call them, they're just directly attached to the head.
119	738	It's when they're at their best.
150	27	Anson picks up the pieces of the old organization
144	270	A directional explosive wired to a pressure-sensitive trigger that's easy to activate, difficult to disarm, and only deadly to the person, standing in front of it means you're probably dealing with an expert.
124	425	So, Kitty, tell us how you got interested in politics.
125	502	I'm up at 6: 00. I'm going upstairs to get Evan.
156	77	There will be a medical emergency in the next few minutes.
153	346	The strain of waiting, worrying, and wondering can drive a trained agent to the brink, much less a civilian.
150	51	Some legitimately, because their identity needs to remain a secret, and some illegitimately, because they're betraying the country they've sworn to protect.
148	352	We don't even know that anybody's really out there.
164	227	what composition the atmosphere is if there is any atmosphere, and so on.
132	336	And I return to find the renegade paramedics are running wild.
144	730	It should be enough to get Jesse back in.
112	107	We know from the legend that the Kraken is capable of taking down tall ships weighing 200 tons.
136	582	Greg comes on strong when you can tell he's scared of prison.
114	491	I thought the whole point of this was to move on.
132	614	People don't start calling till around 10: 00.
120	252	Breathe through it. Start with the water bottles.
134	54	Remember that nsa logistics guy who got caught up in the panamanian banking scandal a couple years back?
137	1199	But, you know, i've seen your boss's type before, and whatever shallow grave he dumps my body in, you're gonna be keeping me company there real soon, pal.
126	419	I'm sure Henry can answer any of your questions.
132	173	I've got five empty bedrooms. You can take your pick.
148	493	All right, all right. I'm ready. Come on. Let's go.
135	68	Yeah, but, mike, I mean, come on. Are you really working with strickler?
151	134	But wouldn't you know it, the stupid jack is busted.
114	17	Know every  that you could possibly want.
146	17	Its name is Charlie. And your nephew's fine, bro. He just needs a little nap.
115	450	But. But when is she coming down?
117	143	There's no time left. I'm... I'm sorry, but I'm confused.
148	528	So, Marsden manages to divert a plane mid-flight...
155	144	Well, security just waved him through and then stopped all the other traffic.
113	119	# Ring bell, hard to tell if anything is going to sell #
150	522	I’m sure Reed will be pretty pissed off when he finds out he was lying.
146	52	Paper shredder? - You seem preoccupied lately.
140	38	I'm sorry. that's not how it works.
125	164	I'm--I'm worried about Kitty going to this event tonight.
131	222	Ask mom if you can come, too.
129	124	He, uh, caught the fish. - He caught some fish.
132	187	But I meant, how are you doing?
161	453	And it was... It was so hot over there. It was...
132	330	This is quite special. - Yes, it is.
126	665	Honorable mention-- that's a very big deal.
145	145	It tastes great at the start, but it goes stale very fast.
153	164	No way. He got out of there?
164	57	as we only see one side of the lunar surface at all times.
145	131	And I say to him,"Is it too late to return them?
123	306	You know, trust me, please. Just, like, a little bit of faith?
160	375	Please, keep going. Dead on. Dead on.
115	172	But yeah, now she's just living with some guy, you know, hoping that he'll propose.
122	489	Feel free, but there goes your invitation to the inaugural ball.
113	9	At first I was scared I was losing my mind.
155	210	You want to keep it that way, don't move.
156	540	Well, then why did we just catch you skipping town?
121	471	What are you doing here? - I came to pick up my phone charger, and I... I figured mom would be asleep, but she's in the kitchen half-sloshed, looking like someone died.
144	194	Uh, I have to deal with this situation first.
163	599	Lost his fulbright scholarship to notre dame.
164	33	With a potent mix of earth science, logic, and the theory of evolution...
113	315	I'm Ethan Wate. Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
145	507	I mean, Maddy's about to lose Takeda, and we still don't know where those girls are.
160	511	Can I talk to him? - You already are.
162	992	Well, don't put your hands up all at once, will you?
131	659	what? You-you laughed. What's so funny?
130	68	And, Kevin, listen, honestly, I'm not trying to butt in.
137	731	I mean, she could be in any one of those buildings, man.
137	823	Let me guess --that your boss?
129	568	Look, I’m not trying to replace him.
134	700	Say no, you'll never hear from me again.
160	81	like a kite tied to a stake.
148	304	Let's go! Let's find this guy!
144	186	Do you know anything about the weapon?
118	272	We're gonna do facials. - Got it.
127	670	Sarah, English is not his first language.
144	191	He deals out of a custom body shop in Kendall.
150	480	Did Jesse make it to the car?
140	564	No, no, no. It can't look like you're helping him.
127	685	Yes? I'm in here.  - Oh, good. Hi.
113	587	Lena, most people spend their entire lives...
113	1274	Lena Duchannes? Why would I invite Lena Duchannes over for dinner?
137	416	Nate, I told you to keep her at home! - You know how she is!
128	31	Oh, have they found anything yet? - Cooper.
113	1245	I still don't know what to get you.  - Huh?
136	341	Can do. Who wants another beer? -Me.
151	32	Maddy, how you doing? Good to see you.
156	724	See, Cody knows the cops could never touch us.
127	179	Oh, my god!  - What... what, did you get shot?
140	655	Valentine was rapping for pocket change when I met him!
151	68	You can pick the station. - No, thanks.
128	111	Yeah, of course he does. It's a massive, open-ended commitment.
128	304	It breaks my heart that he was there.
122	200	So how's sheoing with you bng here?
154	571	You're just gonna hand me to Vanek and walk away?
122	156	You know, maybe--maybe you should go home one night and tuck your children in.
128	116	Actually, there's a benefit at his club tomorrow... a tennis tournament.
141	436	That's 'cause he doesn't have any friends.
154	failed	preview - Mike, what'd you do? - I did what I had to, Sam.
151	406	Tell that bitch if she wants her stuff, she better come and get it herself.
120	319	I don't need-- about how to save costs.
124	253	This is crazy. It's--I mean, what if it doesn't work?
118	44	Uh, well, you're talking to the king of unemployment, and don't wallow.
163	460	He's someone from your past, and he's someone who thinks that you have wronged him.
132	278	You wait until Evan is older.
155	985	I assume we're negotiating the terms of your surrender here then?
142	368	If you want me to go in there, it couldn't matter more.
114	217	Well, then you must have ice water in your veins.
162	293	We're taking the baby home today.
118	464	Oh, come on, Scotty, for god sake.
144	641	Bailey was already gone. He was my target.
137	1100	I don't care if it's not safe here.
140	389	Static records? Man, I don't even
111	415	Get down on the ground! -- Police!
113	228	Says her whole family are Satanists.
155	1011	What's the nature of your injury?
126	399	You don't know that. - Yes, I do. Where are you?
125	335	Well, thank you. I-I think. good-bye, darling.
134	672	No. It's just this in-and-out thing.
121	160	to see if I can repair what's broken with us, to meet Sarah...
151	26	You went to see Fiona, what?
122	427	I have a welcome package here for you with a brochure
120	685	It wasn't as if I was bad at it. I was pretty good. It's just...
128	641	Wh... you're on... - The funeral, the dog tags, all these war stories to Cooper...
122	658	Kitty, that's a terrible idea. You can't dignify that clown by talking to him.
111	73	Moved in here with her husband over 50 years ago, long before I bought the building.
154	596	You want his business or not?
162	1299	They told me to bring her in. How is that OK, Dave?
156	528	What is important... - Hey, you son of a bitch.
113	613	I checked. And in every single one of them schools, they had accidents...
131	481	Kevin, there's no need to shout. - I'm not shouting.
112	374	I know how long the tentacles are and how strong the body has to be to lift them
152	577	I'd appreciate a one-time payment, but I'm more interested in a more permanent position with your group.
125	85	We should--yeah, we should talk, definitely.
130	444	No. But I think you're making this all about you instead of about us.
137	567	I thought you said you rigged her car! - I did!
145	421	An angel? An angel?! How dare you!
115	802	Sweetie, because I was protecting William.
120	558	It's just, you know, what i was saying to Arlo is true.
127	691	William must have bought it in 1973. Listen to this.
120	383	Yeah, she talked a lot about your dad, what an influence he was on her, political and otherwise.
150	133	Abandoned facilities are often used to cover up covert activity.
129	439	That's what you've accomplished - Me and Kitty and Sarah and justin and tommy.
115	97	You're too nervous to have a playdate with Isaac?
116	107	We have to preserve our way of life, "return this great state to the hard-working people who created it"?
119	512	It is indeed my pleasure to take over for William as your host tonight for game night.
125	62	So why don't we hirea dance coach?
123	333	I know you. You won't be able to live with it.
161	408	You know these guys?  - No, I don't know these peopIe!
112	31	They're the biggest multi-armed animals in the world's oceans.
151	258	I barely got two words out of him.
161	5	They'll give you your assignment up there. It's right over there.
144	516	And now you're killing innocent witnesses?
114	388	I will do whatever I want whenever I want.
145	367	It could get pretty rough, Mom.
125	195	And Holly has done so much for this wedding.
136	340	No, keep it small -- Just enough to nudge him in my direction.
113	670	and, my dear, you would think the woman invented the housecoat.
165	353	Anyway, I finally found a venture that would pay me money, but that was when the news came from England that my brother was dead.
113	1488	Hey, is it all right...  - Ah.
131	139	He's texting me the snny minnie web site picked up the story, and there's a picture.
160	44	Why? - 'Cause I don't feel good.
119	413	I'm sorry, did I offend you?
142	96	Prove Nate's alive now, or your project ends here.
120	214	Yeah, it is hard to--to find the right person sometimes.
144	437	Bad news, Mike. They found the truck already.
122	133	You know what? I don't want to sound callous but -.
162	174	Michael, where did these come from?
144	58	Well, it's not the worst thing headed this way.
115	605	Come on, we can't keep it to ourselves.
140	195	No one pays attention unless they're actually on fire.
152	720	I'll call the Agency. I'll take full responsibility.
112	314	That is ridiculously high. That's pretty high, eh?
124	632	I am ready. I-I think I'm ready. I don't know, Sarah. I'm--I'm terrified.
133	76	I heard a rumor about, uh, an old associate of yours who's making a move to miami.
132	490	It's that we don't know if she wants us. - Yeah.
146	410	What the hell? What are you guys doing here?
118	20	Where? - Campaigning. I've never been.
140	749	Thank you, Michael, for trying to protect me from...
142	609	I came by to say this -- you want to play rough, I can give as good as I get.
128	133	Yeah. She's gunning for Mccarty, too.
145	34	So, here we are -- your first official government gig in -- how long has it been?
141	480	Of course, getting a dump truck's tires off the ground is even more difficult than it sounds
140	718	I warned you what would happen if you pulled another stunt, Michael.
116	100	That's not true, Kitty. That's not
142	548	Why are you calling so late? - Honey, I-I'm sorry.
146	244	That's the magic of GPS satellites, Nate. You need to place it under his wheel well.
140	14	The last man who insulted me had to fish pieces of his tongue out of a garbage disposal.
128	543	Well, next time, call me up. I'll walk you straight in.
155	1044	All of which is bad if you're trying to stay off the grid but perfect if you want to attract some attention.
162	199	We've got crisps, different flavours, chocolate, fish fingers.
164	631	the sheer number of stars assures us...
148	376	Well, apparently, blowing things up is one of the few tricks he picked up from the Special Forces.

119	105	Where is she? -- Don't look. Don't look!

136	278	You sell someone an annuity, and they dig deep
161	257	Wow.  - Good evening, sir. Can I get a dollar?
142	293	Three zero five? - Yes. Three-oh-five.
148	308	Holcomb and three other guys have locked down the airport.
119	58	Didn't your brother give you the "just because I'm gay doesn't mean you fix me up with every gay guy you meet" speech?
132	465	Honestly. I'm just - I'm enjoying your company.
164	111	Once the achoms reach the ground...
131	422	We got a car crash at hill and orange grove. Who's responding?
150	43	If Anson doesn't back off his plans, I’m gonna end this, blackmail or no blackmail.
145	418	No. I'm not leaving my wife.
116	615	Just-- just let me be, okay?
116	262	I do research now, but I like keeping in touch with the reason I'm doing it.
150	484	When you're alone in the field, you have to decide whether to take actions that could hurt innocent people, weighing the consequences against what happens if you do nothing.
162	989	Mikey, you can do it, man!
144	591	If you can't see the house, your intel's bad, which would be a shame 'cause I'd hate to waste a bullet on you after all we've been through together.
152	107	Cause, um, I am running out of time.
142	102	In any healthy relationship, there needs to be some give and take.
164	519	it throws out a brilliant flash of sparkling lights all around it...
134	488	A bottle cap packed with a bit of plastic explosive does the trick nicely.
137	598	Don't look at me. I don't get it.
163	72	this is you, right? I mean, you found this girl, right?
146	293	I see someone's been doing a little spring shredding.
154	505	Are you saying we're cut off?
146	338	Okay, just give me the cash. How about that?
113	1279	Except for that damn Civil War thing and meals...
155	79	You called the cops on me?
134	85	I let the local homeland security office know that I was dropping by and leaving that document there.
159	296	That is his cell phone number.
152	121	For a file this big, there's not much here.
152	301	Meyerson, you son of a bitch.
141	334	You know how convincing I can be.
122	674	Good. Now don't let him suck you into a conversation about me.
114	440	Hell, it can swallow you whole if you're not careful.
123	184	And is this the opinion of a politico or a girl who's pissed 'cause her guy's getting slandered?
119	561	For christ sakes, you could have done "park," you know, rhymes with.
155	1231	If we stick around and whatever he's planning doesn't work...
141	226	This -- this -- this wall that you put up.
140	700	No, I want this to go off without a hitch.
142	579	It's okay, bro. I'm getting used to it.
136	490	We're doing this night at a club in hollywood beach -- Amazing.
112	316	One minute you're over the boat;
151	350	I didn't know that. - Shut up.
113	115	The reenactment will be held on the day of the battle, December the 21st.
139	76	Cause they said this guy Michael lives around here.
158	102	l couldn't help but overhear your, uh－ Oh, meltdown?
154	286	Mike said they're gonna be coming out under heavy fire.
115	336	Some of you have been there.
112	206	And we don't know what the male looks like.
137	557	This is not the chart house? - There's no reservations here.
130	554	I-I don't even remember what it's like to have a friend.
126	114	Well, given the amount of hostility and resentment he has towards my family, - I would say, yes, itro probable. - Okay.
112	50	While we're dealing with this octopus, he may attach very firmly to our masks...
127	419	Runners-up did include "Robert Mccallister, national man of mystery
150	517	It's not too late to change your mind, Michael.
127	73	A... are you telling me that you want to quit now?  - Oh, I...
131	165	You don't have to talk to her, all right?
141	74	I know you're angry, Mike, but you got to know who your friends are.
123	605	Oh, and speaking of, I,uh, snaked a sweet corporate rate from the cleaners up the street, so feel free to spill cabernet all over your best shirts.
146	106	But it's just really not convenient for my brother right now.
137	474	Was he talking about me when he said, clean up this mess?
162	1613	Since Mr Coot here finds it all so amusing, maybe you could inform him, Michael, of what happens to our feathered men?
131	579	Well, I mean, I could come over and maybe make you some dinner.
115	832	There's just something I want to say.
155	981	Gas mileage in a crown vic has got to be brutal.
141	519	He told me I have to pay him. Otherwise
142	385	Could you put my partner on?
138	314	Well, he doesn't need to run to nicaragua.
146	117	But half of you are better than all of most people.
132	182	Okay. If you need anything else, why don't you just call?
150	82	We're gonna forget this ever happened. - This isn't over.
153	477	Oh, this isn't a chase anymore, Mr. Axe.
124	680	Wow, these robes are like wearing heaven.
122	265	I can't stand the thought  of that stately mansion  being defiled  by Mccallister and company.
111	329	That's why he dumped the stuff. He didn't come for him.
120	77	Uh, you didn't know who D.J.Dash was.
114	127	When did you die? - 87.
147	41	This guy's name is Ben. And it's not just any boat.
132	17	Well, is there any way that maybe you can do that stuff at our place?
155	933	She couldn't get us, so she gave the job to a cartel who wanted me dead.
131	489	I'd love some. - Finally. Someone with an appetite.
146	452	Get back! I’m going to end this.
164	556	An asteroid collision with a life-supporting planet would be catastrophic.
141	372	What if we get rid of Roth?
119	111	Oh, it's been so long, are you getting your Easter dinner?
140	627	That's, like, too gangster for me right there, man.
152	158	In fact, you've said it a couple of times now.
131	182	I know. I can't believe the attention she's getting either.
137	1317	A lot of people think the word commando means superhero, or at least something close to it.
140	53	After the breakup, Veronica took the caddie back,
113	1115	Why don't we just admit it?  - Admit what?
118	414	If you don't want to get tested... - Could we just concentrate on the fris salad, please?
156	271	Why do I get the feeling you bit off more than you can chew?
155	1048	Do we have a visual on Riley?
114	523	So, thanks for ruining my death.
113	1064	Now your mother shows up on my doorstep and damn near gives me a heart attack!
123	123	Oh, come on. Come on, Lizzie.
112	264	As a Norwegian bishop wrote in 1755, the Kraken's arms reached as high as the mast of a mid-sized vessel.
130	709	Oh, um, are Kevin and Scotty here yet?
115	527	Would you shut up, all right? I'm not dad.
132	318	Well, the same way, except for with ballet lessons and shopping for outfits.
120	137	And I keep telling him he's gotta cultivate these relationships.
118	369	No, I did not... - You know what? Fine. I'm not going.
160	128	[ Kip ] Your mom goes to college.
120	185	It's all happening so early these days.
164	302	The same would be true for life on our theoretical planet AG-143.

119	744	You just show'em your F minor 9th.
115	882	My family and I take full responsibility for our decision to conceal the truth from our friends, colleagues and from the american public.
130	409	Okay, Paige, I know what you're doing.
137	237	So he was just stepping upto the exciting world of blackmail and smack dealing.
129	68	Do you want some milk with that? - Yes, please.
123	152	By having it. - Okay, I'm not "fine.
124	92	Okay, Nora, this guy is big-time now.
154	517	0% chance of working anything out.
146	502	No, actually, you crashed into me, but that doesn't matter now.
132	381	Imagine being that wounded at 9 years old, you don't trust anyone.
115	711	Bingo really has been gone a very long time.
128	634	No one. It was a forfeit. Come on.
164	620	In this way, you can absorb the entire output of a star without getting burned in the process.
153	132	What？ - d- don't try and talk.
163	132	Chief yates, Jennifer Jareau, we spoke on the phone.
132	553	Are - are you happy? - yes, I'm happy and relieved.
146	528	All we need is cash. How much can you get your hands on?
145	559	Now... My firm gives me a little, uh, discretionary fund for emergencies.
161	603	You better believe it! Come on, man!
115	109	And he's interesting. He's very interesting.
123	139	Don't mind him, Tommy. He's just cranky from the drive.
137	891	I'm just checking out the competition
142	27	Just a way to say thank you for chatting to us about his big brother.
124	619	Listen, she will take a little while, then one day, she will turn up with
123	7	Look, I know he's gone. - I know it hurts. I'm sorry.
137	1109	There are some fights you just can't win.
112	289	Large fin whales, sperm whales, blue whales.
149	277	Cute. Pearce hooked us up with them.
126	273	I mean, does Sarah even know what's going on?
127	76	He will handle it. It... you know, the truth is,
155	181	Jesse! you got a back door?
136	402	I'll -- i'll get the dishes. -Thank you.
152	126	The ballistics report says the sniper rifle used to kill Nate was made by Meyerson Industries.
114	44	I should make a 7-layer dip, right?
141	617	Now hang up, get out of the car, leave the money in the trunk, and make him come to it.
141	379	I-I-I can't. I don't have time. I have to get ahold of Roth.
127	350	You two need to understand my reality.
163	434	So, what we have to do is sacrifice our friend and we're safe.
112	33	I mean this is the Kraken. It's not a squid and it's not an octopus.
140	92	Really? It's a perfectly good machine.
117	171	He wants to spend his birthday with his family, exactly the way he's done for the past 38 years in a row.
120	718	I was with Kyle. - What?
158	50	Let go of me. Just－ Uh-oh.
147	155	He sounds like a sweetheart. - He's as sadistic as they come.
153	175	Mike, what the hell happened in that hotel?
163	418	They, along with the girls, are his targets, and it may be the key to finding him before it's too late.
116	399	This is the only thing you remember when, you know, when you get through everything.
160	93	Well, what's there to eat? - Knock it off, Napoleon.
125	156	See you later. - You'll love it. It's the blue room.
137	274	You pose as a fellow target of your own blackmail scheme, that way you'll always know what the victims are up to.
118	260	It ain't exactly the ritz around here.
155	1199	The marina security guard was working with the cartel.
155	1170	Let's just say someone's future got a little brighter.
141	593	You got a problem, you let me know. Geez.
164	51	to have liquid water and stay liquid water.
117	159	Why don't you?  - Enough.
156	254	Listen, I got to wrap this up.
111	371	Which is more than I can say for Myron over here.
131	543	And he's also working on some shorttories.
115	408	I have a special needs son, and in my opinion, adamson has done a disservice to his own son and to his constituency.
149	212	Fine. I'll check out Cutler Bay.
160	85	Well, I want you to go see if Tina wants some of this. - [ Fly Buzzing ]
118	551	We better be,cause we open in a month.
146	85	Best spa in Miami the mist at the darabont hotel.
141	558	So -- so this is gonna work out?
125	92	And, um, seeing as this is something we want to do eventually,
140	111	Oh, man. you wouldn't believe it.
164	445	For hundreds of years, scientists believed that sunlight was the only energy source for life.
119	732	I used to try and figure out that crazy family dynamic
145	582	I mean, first of all, it's secret.
134	125	You know, she's done everything she could.
154	43	I cannot wait for all of you to get the hell out of my house and out of the country.
115	523	I mean, take my marriage for example.
132	90	I told you, you should just go.
141	542	Hey, you were right about how Larry's coming after Jeannie.
129	641	I’m sure not. - Well, how do you know?
155	78	I'll reach you on this burner.
127	178	Hey, you utter the word "ban" in front of this crowd, and they're gonna be shooting more than just photographs.
153	196	Fi. - I see it, Michael.
126	24	Yes. I'll pretend we've never met. Hey, we're on.
118	395	I just found out that he...
115	419	Why would you be back in your ranchero?
161	685	No, I don't like that rule.  - No, it's good.
137	1280	You give me that, I will come in alive.
124	330	Yeah. Still grumpy? - Yeah. He's the worst.
164	381	Flying squirrels put flaps out of their fur...
118	367	No, no, you're not trying to compromise.
148	159	Well, it's nice to be dealing with people who carry Blackberrys instead of guns for a change.
152	287	Sounds like Quinn's about to crawl out of whatever hole he's been hiding in.
132	718	I thought that I had seen every frame of Walker family home movies ever shot.
128	151	Uh, no, because I am actually trying to make lasagna.
115	477	She's upstairs getting ready for Isaac.
151	501	I'm the one that you want. Let Sam go.
148	82	Murder victim was a Romanian war criminal.
147	368	Time to get him to show us those files.
113	1132	It's feeling scared and not being able to do anything about it...
129	51	I wake up every morning and go for a run, but it feels like no matter how much I run, I still can't sleep.
151	480	There was a backpack thingy. It had a bomb in it. She made me wear it.
142	496	There's no other way, Barry. Mike's counting on you.
127	352	But that's four weeks. Honey, you should tell him to wait.  - Ugh.
145	604	I mean it's going to be a shelf.
130	316	Because she was so shiny and popular. - No.
163	617	they reacted just the way I knew they would.
114	368	Deny，him his right to know how the world really is?
125	192	You should put your arm around me. - Mom, mom, mom, no. This is weird.
137	702	No, don't talk like that. You're not good at it.
113	617	signed by over 300 Gatlin parents who demand...
150	45	I’m all set, Michael. Where are you?
155	898	Hide behind the desk, don't move.
116	691	And we'll put it right there. - Oh, that's good.
125	137	I-I woke up this morning, and I don't--I don't know,
122	76	His leg's the same. - She hasn't talked to him yet.
141	232	Besides, we tried counseling. You quit, remember?
124	403	if that's mom again, just tell her we're okay, all right?
139	168	Fi, would you like to make a new friend?
148	336	Well, you know how Mikey is with commitment.
132	716	She gave 'em to me. So I kept 'em.
123	479	You know what? I... I'm just...I mean... - oh. Oh, god. No.
146	270	Only if you don't care about getting yogurt lady's boat. My guy called.
141	55	Michael, you think I would hurt you?
113	783	Macon.  - It's all right, Lena.
120	677	Look, that wasn't an angle, okay?
162	420	I didn't realise you wanted another one so much.
131	276	But I have to admit, I'm a little surprised that you are interested in him.
129	658	Oh, uh, yeah, I-I- She was amazing, and it hit me...
117	530	No, no. Okay. It's fine. I - I get it.
114	398	I never liked the idea of taking up space...
155	1087	Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Axe.
151	110	But first, I have to survive. You got to help me, Ayn.
161	827	Thanks.  - Dude, this is gonna be blogged, for sure!
158	200	Also, never call 9 1 1. They take forever.
131	273	Well, Seth's 27 years old. He can date whomever he wants.
112	329	That means I'm going up there.
130	510	People and politics... It was always your calling.
150	210	You can't exactly run around a security conference, yelling, "i want to betray my country".
159	119	When we say, "Jump," the rest of the world says, "How high"?
146	483	Now, let's find out what this pig's last words are going to be.
136	87	She lives right across the street.
130	697	Kitty, shh. It's fine. - No, no, you have to go. Go on.
123	190	Send him waltzing on in, Lisa.
149	258	Ever occur to you maybe you're wrong? I'm not wrong.
125	580	And I get all the handbags I want.
163	269	Yes, I know, sir. If you'd just come with me. I will explain everything. All right?
120	209	look, I'm new here, and I'm supposed to find a sponsor, and I mean, I don't know if you already have, like, a ton of sponsees, but-- um, uh, no, I-I-I don't have any.
155	1206	You think we can get to the road this way?
111	426	I mean, we know you shot Dion and that nice old lady.
152	35	I guess I'm still on a prison schedule.
147	535	We're postponing the South American portion of the operation till we sort things out, but you... …you'll be well taken care of.
113	555	Like your family's been doing for too many years. Don't roll your eyes at me.
124	166	Oh, please. It's an open-ended policy that just drives down wages.
154	204	We got to lose these guys! Can't you shoot out their tires?
126	721	We're just having lunch before Simon leaves town.
162	597	It's like he's something... in between.
136	594	I’m going to the bank like we said.
163	476	You shut the hell up, you're nothing but a pervert.
131	475	Well, uh, it's a fair where prospective parents get to meet with kids that need homes.
112	167	It's almost like a torpedo, you know? Yeah.
123	604	So your appointment with the web guy is on friday, and, boy, does he need some fashion tips.
124	164	The temporary guest-worker program? It's amnesty.
155	224	Oh... it's nothing a six-pack won't fix.
113	40	never knowing what part of my fife I'd have to act in next.
156	818	To do what we do you have to be willing to give up everything.
111	209	But he couldn't make rent, so they gave him the boot.
162	1133	I do that every day. It keeps Arthur away.
111	554	Coming from a guy who's trying to make her give up her baby, you know.
155	612	40 seconds -- they're going to find us, Michael.
149	241	He's using Benny to spy on you...
113	1294	for something or someone you love more than yourself.
159	141	and it is uninformed, and it is dangerous.
134	604	I'm father Peter. Our lady of grace charities.
155	299	Sam, you said it just grazed you.
151	339	Not to mention anyone who ran into your friend Anson.
156	656	Let's just say it's the most important meeting you're going to have all day.
131	215	Karl is coming, too, but he's just gonna have to deal with it.
123	273	The only option I have left is you, rebecca.
119	590	Yeah. It's a movie about a meddlesome cat who sticks her nose in where it doesn't belong and gets run over by a bus.
158	643	And it still is. Here. l dare you not to win.
124	562	And you hit on him? Nora?
151	230	Sounds like I need a shakedown.
129	529	I - Well, I do, and so I know.
115	158	Okay, fine, i'll drop it. -Good.
129	32	All right. Okay. I-I-I was... I was practicing.
146	80	You got me a gift? - Yeah.
146	562	Probably sounds crazy. - no, it makes perfect sense.
162	1085	Right, get out your exercise books, everyone.
158	347	So, Jake tells me you're a loser.
161	783	It's weird. I guess it's like when a mother lifts an automobile off a child.
151	132	Hey. How you doing? - You okay?
158	334	You know what? l gave up years ago. it's my secret to happiness.
130	38	What else did Scotty have to say?
140	373	Without them, these platinum records got no place on my wall.
139	432	Yeah. Told him to make the block once and head down the alley.
164	155	But if we have examples, we have one data point, in fact...
146	42	I’ve been going back to gamblers anonymous.
147	375	Do you have brain damage? Have you forgotten? You're a mercenary.
122	90	Oh, my god! I can't believe it! Kevin just called. I nearly drove off the road!
137	176	Am I to be your new drinking buddy?
165	91	You had a touch of scurvy.
149	427	I'll be fine, Michael. Just get up the stairs fast. Get Sophie out of there.
156	282	We want to share, but we need a safe place to work.
116	95	Why didn't you tell me any of this? Did you tell Robert?
119	628	Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to invite her to a family event where she's bound to feel like an outsider.
124	413	He was painted a total loser by a class of first graders.
145	571	It happened, for better or for worse.
123	97	So you're gonna love this accounting program. And as the business grows, you can expand the functionality to handle online orders.
124	379	We haven't seen each other for 30 years, and somehow...
144	256	Just the cute, little apartment complex manager lady.
112	517	All right, here we go. Let's roll.
129	435	You're gonna let her hoity-toity education intimidate you?
135	97	Anyway, fi's in there helping clean up.
129	47	What's bothering you? - Nothing's bothering me. I’m fine.
140	706	That burns at 3, 000 degrees.
122	2	Nora, he'll call. I promise you, he will call.
152	325	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
132	529	I'm sorry. You know what? You just said it yourself.
154	472	Two men patrolling the second floor.
146	246	I mean, of course, it does look better on me, but it looks pretty good on you.
120	298	I know. I have to be quiet. We're just about to flush a cove are you-- are you in a bathroom?
148	160	All right. Maddy, you go get set up in short-term parking.
142	262	Yeah, well, the cat cost you 2 grand. At least.
125	675	And he can stay here as long as he likes, as long as you like.
130	84	Would you care for some? - Yes, thank you.
116	657	You just gotta pick your battles.
124	217	Hmm? Uh, no. N no. Why, uh, why?
114	559	Just did the tour. - Yeah? Awesome.
124	598	Your briefing on Espinoza was dead-on.
118	521	Oh, god, mom. I love you, but you have to stop.
155	1147	Good, 'cause there's a big-ass yacht coming in.
129	19	Okay. Okay. I will organize it.
155	199	Access is blocked to the back of the building.
140	209	Just there to keep white-collar workers from stealing coffee cups.
118	685	Yes. - Here. This is the mac and cheese.
151	279	Clipping trees, landing near power lines, that kind of thing.
142	269	And I left my cell phone in my jacket.
164	606	could build a planetary highway to space...
113	155	Moved around since I was 4, after my parents died.
145	434	Nothing to report, other than that the boss is on his third green tea.
125	158	I think that I should probably stay for just a couple more days, just to make sure, you know, that I don't have some sort of setback.
148	674	You know the first thing I do when I start an investigation?
118	391	I-I just never thought that I ne...- Is there a reason for concern now?
131	68	You're dear mom, right? -  yes.
160	213	I wish I could grow one.
140	273	I just say that I need some alone time to ponder the whole Veronica thing.
134	308	you're the lawyer. Just figure it out.
118	71	Yeah. But she didn't take the job yet, so I was actually trying to convince her to come with me.
131	461	Mom can make roast chicken like peanut butter and jelly. She can do it in her sleep.
144	405	I thought you guys were both at H. Q. getting fired.
113	1460	I'll call you as soon as I get in.
120	86	Thanks to your brilliant idea, he's there trying to partner up with a neighboring orchard.
150	488	And when it's done, all you can do then is carry on with the operation, knowing that it's your job to repair the hurt you're about to cause and the damage you're about to do - or die trying.
165	319	Mary port for my sister, and because it's a fair haven.
113	248	Okay.  - You can go now.
117	755	Does that mean it worked, mom? I don't know.
112	218	Squid have killer weapons two long tentacles that lash out and grab prey at lightning-quick speed.
128	530	You got a line on what's next?
128	443	I thought you were working on contracts. Where have you been, Wimbledon?
137	453	That's the point. They don't know. This is yours.
153	34	Listen to me, Michael. Gray killed Anson.
117	311	After that, I don't know what I'm gonna do. Oh, I'm sorry, Sarah.
162	1302	Moving us into some old wreck with damp and no central heating!
122	127	After des moines, we go to cedar rapids.
125	447	Look, I didn't even want to dance.
113	1067	No matter what you do, no matter what they do to me, I'm still here.
121	35	paranoid personality type with accompanying morbid insecurity disorder.
132	531	Would you please - please do not leave like this?
161	506	Oh, yeah, and I'd like my walkie-talkie back. Over.
164	360	This world, with much lower gravity...
123	458	It’ll be easier this way. I know it doesn't seem fair or rational...
136	199	See, I was roommates with your buddy Paco for a year.
142	116	And now you're living here. With his mom?
145	93	That's not exactly how I would put it -- Fi! Fi.
150	173	Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I’m always like this before an op.
136	331	Of course, it wouldn't have been a problem if I didn't have someone second-Guessing me and slowing the whole thing down.
140	134	No. I wouldn't last 15 minutes.
150	66	Not when everything you fought for is so close.
137	303	Want me to come with you?
132	291	Why would you want to go back into the snake pit?
136	216	Anyone ever tell you you're hard at making friends?
128	91	How serious are you guys about this?
165	156	It's just that I've longed to hear those words.
151	422	When the charge is detonated, the explosive is converted into compressed gas, and the shock wave rips through anything within 16 feet, which means that if five of those charges are in your backpack, anyone within a city block is in your blast radius, too.
113	67	My mother has officially flown that extra bat-shit mile since Dad died.
151	569	You know, I've been thinking about that damn package for the last 24 hours.
118	732	Release them. - Let's release them.
113	845	Oh, just another good girl gone bad, I guess.
119	216	It's supposed to be very hip, and tea's the new coffee and all that.
141	450	Yeah, I-I think it's happening now.
129	586	Oh, come on, Sarah. You know I’m not like that.
147	581	I don't trade favors for blood. - Why do you say that?
137	985	It's armored. - i'll see you back at Nate'S.
144	377	Taking control of a situation isn't always about having the tactical advantage.
137	981	Oh, no, Fi, they are that good.
115	843	So I wouldn't yell at you, right?
134	100	Don't change the subject. I want to know were you expecting a guest?
160	101	Try and hit me, Napoleon. - What?
140	372	These are bases I used to build this label from the street up.
111	538	It's gonna take some time, Emma, but they love you and...
152	94	He ran the Dorchester Hill Gang up in Boston before he went on the lam.
124	201	Please. - Lift your butt up.
130	433	Fancy seeing you here. - I swear, I'm not stalking you.
124	387	maternal space incapable of expending its progeny.
147	612	Benny, may I introduce my son, Michael? - Michael.
145	499	We can't let them follow us back.
160	21	and all those who seek for the peaceful existence of our underwater ally.
158	602	Oh. Who wants to meet my friend Mr. Dom Perignon?
164	602	they can theoretically do 10, 000 years worth of thinking in 3 1/2 days.
136	45	What did they talk to you about? What did they ask?
163	578	Listen, it's like like those soccer players who crashed in the andes.
162	145	You know that's our wall you're sitting on?
147	439	If you're here with Jackson's blessing, why is it he left me a team of his own commandos and failed to mention your bloody existence?!
165	460	Jeremiah Blackthorn has no right to his fortune.
125	460	I think the tango was not a good idea.
117	356	If Robert gets this job, whatever this job is, then... Yes, we've agreed that Washington should be our home base.
132	116	Yeah, I'm - I'm afraid that i'm gonna have to cancel - No, wait. Wait.
146	200	As a spy, you get used to people having whispered conversations about you.
126	208	Well, as soon as I found out this guy Carlsson was stealing from me,
142	431	We probably just missed him. This beer is still cold.
116	64	Oh, well, you can't blame Evan for that.
113	1021	He's at Savannah Snow's party, which is where all the kids are.
140	428	Would you, uh... hold this for a second?
121	502	Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. - No.
159	390	The Karasz leases are a big prize, David.
137	410	Because my rates are a little
158	240	Thanks. Oh! l got it. l got it. l got it.
153	213	I don't even know the guy that well.
120	589	And you're working anyway, Rebecca, so...
151	439	She doesn't want your guns or your drugs or your chemistry set.
140	536	Sorry. I wish I could help you, guy -- I really do but it's risky. Too risky.
138	248	You want Charlie celebrating his 8th birthday in a hut in nicaragua?
115	159	The thing is that mom knows something's going on between justin and Tommy.
151	592	No idea. Anson sent it to me.
153	474	When the extra bodies get here, we move in and we take Westen out.
119	262	Two. Two and a half years, maybe.
161	156	And how's that working for you?  - Not at all.
132	317	Well, how have you been picturing it?
132	452	I thought of something fabulous we can do tomorrow.
123	119	And just out of curiosity, what was a time that the two of you were completely happy?
156	459	Okay, Fiona, the wire should be about a foot to your left.
113	134	She kept saying, "I'll never let you go, never," and then she lets him go!
118	523	No, I don't believe, as a family, we can't help each other.
120	618	Robert should've fired me today, but he didn't.
132	472	Where are you going? - Anywhere but here.
141	495	Well, who knows? Maybe we'll get another chance to work together again some day.
155	348	You know what? I am. actually, I got this wicked kink in my neck.
146	386	This guy Fickas is a clerk. He sits on the dispatch desk.
124	610	Yes, I'm--I'm quitting because it's not gonna work.
156	775	Frakes, no, listen... listen to me, listen to me.
155	1068	Using a narrow path takes their vehicles out of the equation, but if you have time to set your escape route beforehand, the best way to win a foot chase is on two wheels.
129	139	We'll put you on the air, and- On the-on the on the air today?
112	357	This mast looks a lot taer from up here than it does down there, doesn't it?
161	606	You got it! Well, maybe just get one of them. Here. Here you go!
131	330	You indicated here in your preferences that you'd be willing to consider any case, regardless of gender, race, or age? - That's all right.
130	114	Well, wait. Wait. Why don't we work together?
161	831	You know, Terry's just always been crazy.
145	403	And I'll give Fi a call -- see how she's doing with Huxley.
148	348	You guys - Who the hell do you think you are, giving orders?
155	806	Okay, now I just got to put that... wait a minute.
113	403	You came back.  - Yeah. I... I'm sorry.
116	44	Call the police! There's an insane man outside!
162	1438	Them as can dance should dance.
159	304	Maybe I can get Dora to get a billing address for his cell phone.
128	587	Is she busy? - Uh, yeah, yeah, she was.
117	126	Did you? No. but come on, honestly, somebody has to tell her in no uncertain terms, Kevin is not coming.
146	40	Look, you know Vegas isn't the right kind of place for me.
137	640	It's better to hear it from me.
128	62	What do you want... peanut butter and jelly, string cheese and grapes?
147	197	You know, I could have taken him myself easily.
146	178	You know, she figured you'd say that. And for a second there, I was nervous.
111	561	You are the only person that realized what she really wanted.
131	391	Look... Kitty, I mean - I've got my keys, so... I am so glad you're here.
115	776	Next time I'm in town, can we go to dinner, just the two of us?
154	160	Thank you, Dixon, for making us wait in the hot parking lot.
165	125	Perhaps you'd like to tell him how you refused me.
132	521	You - you are so true to who you are, and who you are is an amazing, strong
154	120	No, no, no, no. Sam, Sam.
129	457	Just relax. - I can do it.
112	466	This is where, like, you find out that I'm your father.
152	160	Why don't you let me decide that?
134	174	Stuffed shirt over there is Erik Luna.
132	511	God, I can't believe that you're doing this.
117	567	Yeah, he says he'll be there to pick up the pieces. Oh.
154	190	No, what you need do is tell us who's in those cars you've been watching.
131	101	So why don't you give Vinny to me?
125	565	That would be perfect. - Good.
150	283	Well, you know, I assume that has something to do with this warrant for your arrest on sexual assault charges?
128	575	I just hope no one got a picture,'cause that would be bad publicity.
134	438	I don't mind doing the dirty work while you golf with your fancy little friends, as long as you keep your nose clean.
126	142	Hi. Could you connect me to Dennis york, please?
113	1470	I thought your, uh, poems in Creative Writing...
162	972	Nothing. Just remembered I've got a test.
154	66	Nate's little boy has already lost his father.
127	11	I had to walk into yours  -  "Casablanca
127	709	Yes. I was just dropping off some wine for you as a thank-you gift for giving me a shot.
156	587	You're clear to go to the server room.
117	186	Michelle gets her blood test today.
136	531	Everybody's always looking  for a good one.
132	596	Well, William must have stored it here.
165	512	Ah, I can tell when a man is feeling guilty.
146	21	Well, it's not every day you can get a pedicure.
159	310	Well, Mother, we were hoping for something a little more upbeat.
118	199	Not that I-I'm not happy for you.
156	336	Our server's protected by a firewall the N. S.A. couldn't crack.
164	200	Shorter, squattier, but heavy like this...
131	154	Dating me is a crime now?
129	418	Okay, we're gonna break for the news and be back with more "dear mom" in just a few minutes.
142	203	No. Come on, man, I --the blade came off, and it fell.
111	609	Do you guys want to watch with me?
128	214	Oh, go left, go left, go left!
164	286	but hunt any creatures that may have found their way to the oasis...
146	355	Pretty sweet, huh? I told you I should be hunting bigger game.
117	518	You know, the first time when it didn't work out,
113	801	You two are as thick as thieves, aren't you?
162	512	And these are for your friend.
116	597	And-- and welcome, uh, to the second-annual fund-raiser for open doors.
163	288	I'm sorry, sir. Mr. Chambers just took off.
140	697	So shoot Victor and take a look. What's the problem?
130	690	I would take one from this one and give to that one, but, ladies, the pyramid has collapsed.
161	54	I'm not joking.  - Me, either.
122	72	It's Kitty. - Mom. Wanna trade?
111	367	It's too bad poor Maya didn't take that offer, too.
129	613	Oh, thank you for everything, Frank.
155	243	Not a huge plane, but, you know, something big enough to get five people to the Bahamas.
137	890	You thought, what, you could just come down here and rip me off?
119	627	Oh, well, you know what, Justin?
111	172	We weighed all our options, and what we've decided is that adoption would give Emma the most closure.
124	344	I'm going to go in here now. I just have to heat up my son's lunch. I will be back.
153	172	That better be the last time you lie to me today.
135	440	So imaginewhat's gonna happen when we get our handson bennett tash.
140	161	Okay. class is in session. Now listen carefully.
140	268	Just take a little bit. Little sippy sip.
128	67	Honestly, what do you want me to do, starve him?
112	486	Nice seams. Is it thicker than this, even?
123	408	I'm...I'm mad at his dead father for letting him go even though begged him not to.
153	502	Let's just hope Mike's call makes this worth it.
126	491	What decision? - Hey, come on, guys. What's going on? You're supposed to be finished.
112	429	Yeah. Is that evil enough for you?
125	166	And she'll be around so many people, and her white blood cellcount is down and her immune system is not strong.
118	176	But, you know, this stop, maybe you should start out with immigration reform instead of tax cuts.
145	384	maybe I miscalculated the dosage. - Maybe?"
124	668	100%. I-I totally did. I totally did. I just...
149	371	Just up to the I-O bridge, right?
131	560	Frankly, this entire meal feels like a group therapy session to me, and usually those come in 50-minute increments.
152	26	If you need  to requisition a weapon, get an interrogation log to an analyst, or even arrange an emergency  evac from a hostile territory, a bureaucrat can be your best friend.
156	250	Power grid's protected by Homeland Security.
161	882	What happened? - Somebody punched me.
141	311	Got an e-mail from our client.
113	647	For example, if I were to donate the old mill...
125	621	I'm so sorry if--if I've been unkind in anyway.
123	235	Well, I'll drink to that. - hear, hear.
137	132	Oh, it's probably just a friend.
126	422	oh, my gosh. I can't belie you did all of this.
132	541	He's alive because you were willing to take a risk.
132	470	Holly, I don't want you to do anything you don't want to do.
124	576	And you were so busy being insecure, you didn't even notice that he was trying to impress you.
132	310	No, I have to learn how to do stuff like this.
118	715	Would you be happy any other way?
116	120	Look, I don't want you to play anything. Let Kern take care of him, okay?
140	571	You come on out and face me like a man!
112	208	I reckon the male is even more aggressive than this.
131	69	I'm a big fan. - no.
140	239	A way to make it look like he actually earned this money.
125	225	Yeah, I'm not--I really don't think he's gonna dance with you.
116	430	Just let her have her happy moment, and then she'll stupidly jump off the cliff.
112	85	And you can feel his muscles flexing in underneath there.
161	315	Cause I don't think we need to get their belongings now.
119	159	Kitty, sweetheart, no one would have blamed you if you not insisted vehemently that you knew the answer.
130	509	Kitty, the whole neighborhood knew who you were and where you were going from the time you were 8 years old because you went door-to-door introducing yourself.
140	250	And the next day, you do the Michael westen thing, stuff starts exploding,
146	383	I can't get arrested. - Well, there are worse things than getting arrested.
148	118	Only problem is, all my guys look like FBI agents.
119	201	Kitty will never agree to this.
152	178	Which is working like a dream.
113	747	Get in.  - Oh, I wasn't invited.
153	237	Ma, there's no time. I'll explain it in the morning.
131	570	You know, you're really amazing at this, Justin.
155	125	The trick is finding a union rep willing to shuffle your paperwork to the top, and then, of course, providing him with the proper motivation.
151	380	We're only talking a few hours.
116	140	Look, believe me, this is Holly's project.
158	472	Thank you. l appreciate that. Want some herbal tea? We have some.
130	253	See you at the photo shoot. Oh.
124	346	I can't believe I have to sit there and listen to this pompous nonsense just because Saul wants a boyfriend.
128	329	What were you doing outside anyway?
165	356	I had to return to manage it.
150	478	10 minutes to game time, everybody.
127	667	Luc, I'm sorry. I'm not cool with this.
150	324	I need all-stars, so, that elite cia team you've been running
136	190	To catch one, you've got to beat him at his own game, be a better liar than he is.
155	237	One of the best ways to do this is known as story telling
149	398	Y-yeah, t-the - the fence is too close to the building, so it's, um - it's causing a power surge. It fried a capacitor already. It'll do it again.
132	538	Are you trying to help me or are you trying to impress annie?
113	1127	Everybody has to deal with shit in their lives, Lena.
118	752	You know, every time we think about having a big wedding, something bad happens.
115	693	Are you all deliberately trying to embarrass me?
161	515	You got a real stupid laugh, you know that, Don?
123	46	You don't need to keep a vigil for me. - Okay, fine.
153	215	From what I know of the Michael Westen dossier, if he got married tomorrow, you'd be his best man.
158	9	Okay. l'm turning over a new leaf, and my good luck starts now.
159	162	I can't believe our dear mother compared us to Southern Democrats.
118	789	Justin, Justin. I think he's really hurt.
150	591	Michael that was quite a disaster at the airport today.
118	519	There's nothing there, mom. If there was, they would've found it by now.
154	265	What? That's the plan? - Keep moving.
126	407	Don't you mean Paige? - No. I mean, yeah. J-- look, just get down here.
161	565	It's where they set the booby trap for the pedophiles.
136	95	I called, and they congratulated me, said they had to send some people over to fill out some tax forms.
161	510	To who?  - To the people I stole it from.
150	248	I have a business proposition for you, Mr. Porter.
120	422	You look old and ugly all the time.
111	173	And as we said, that's our top priority.
164	201	adapted to a planet with much stronger gravity.
141	352	I didn't want to, kid, believe that. But you got sloppy.
149	484	Is this thing about ready? Well, we have to solder a few more leads.
147	168	I hope you enjoyed the tour.
125	53	That we sway. That we just sway.
112	76	Look, he's really hanging onto the...
131	261	Dispatch, this is unit five. We're on our way.
135	175	Stay calm, barry. Michael's just doinga perimeter check.
114	342	I've been feeling bad about the whole grope-and-ditch.
125	108	No, no, I--I'm serious. I mean, I could quit my job, and that way, I could make my handbags full-time.
113	645	However, since my ancestors founded Gatlin...
114	417	You've been dead since '87 and you have no desire to move on?
142	303	I just finished stealing a hardware key with an agency routing code.
132	107	You know, nora, I'm worried that if she doesn't come now, she's never gonna come.
149	271	Oh. That sounds mysterious. What is it?
160	10	What are you gonna do today, Napoleon?
114	31	Tell me you brought more coffee.
121	467	Oh, you know, I would love to, but we've run out of your fabulous absinthe tea, so I was hoping that you could - come back and mix up another batch. - Oh, no. We're not out. We have the whole pitcher right here.
119	609	My brother made it crystal clear to me that he doesn't ever want to see him again, and frankly, Kevin, I'm inclined to agree with him.
155	1289	Mount 2-1, report when you have them on target and tracking.
131	455	Karl, what's your book called? - the empowered unconscious.
149	433	Shouldn't be too hard to get their attention.
137	302	Or he just likes watching me run around in this heat.
164	74	in where they want to go and where they want to hunt.
118	207	You cannot bear the weight of ojal going out of business all by yourself.
124	131	No, I-I can be Kevin for a week.
132	515	your options? I thought that I w - I was a part of your options.
140	529	The fbi's tailing me. They're taking pictures.
163	14	Very nice. - Come on, guys.
135	151	Amy's in atlantataking care of her aunt.
121	56	That's like the elevator stalled between floors. - We did agree - to be friends early on. - Mom, you love your job. You enjoy Karl's company.
156	698	You want to talk to your lawyer, we're going to have to arrest you, take you downtown, which means no deal for you.
127	74	Because if you do you, you...  - Telling a U. S. Senator that you want to date other people... is not easy.
129	541	By loss and-and moving on...- Okay, bye.
161	524	Damn it! You ready for this, Don?
113	516	I don't know, hurry up.  - Say yes.
122	260	Kevin, stop! - Bite her, mom. Bite her!
163	631	To play, to win, everyone pushing, everyone watching, I hated it.
125	544	I'm telling you now that I--I just--I really want to feel normal.
113	781	Isn't that sweet? He's all choked up.
115	490	Oh, come on now. Come on.
155	1286	I'm getting nothing on the radio.
122	549	wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What-- what are you doing?
122	63	Come on, you and Joe were shouting it out on top of the washing machine, what, a week ago, and you're still wearing your ring.
126	342	Stop. Stop. - Mom. - Wait. What are we stopping?
145	288	Your wife isn't the teasing sort?
146	368	It's time to give Wallace some bad news about his employee of the month.
114	323	If we have to, like, put a number on this...
124	617	Yeah, but it'll be your dump. what? What?
127	677	Don't tell me you have never seen "The Graduate.
162	544	Don't we even have sodding matches in this house?
117	759	Oh! Kevin! Okay, we just heard that you were pregnant out there. Halfway pregnant.
146	412	What are you talking about? - recognize that boat, pig?
113	1025	Oh, I'm sorry you had to go to that trouble, ma'am.
124	256	Coop and I stayed around looking for you, but, uh, you obviously went somewhere.
142	64	You know, I would be, but it seems that a rival cartel got an anonymous shipment of Ak-47s and rocket launchers, so those angry South Americans were a little busy, what with all the killing and dying.
122	533	I made an eagle and a flag, too.
161	97	The freak actually came through, huh?
144	264	Looks like the storm took out the cell towers.
113	320	Tell him you can't stay.  - I'd love to. Thank you, sir.
144	76	I guess with Simon, you have to expect the unexpected.
124	280	According to Nora, there's been some misunderstanding.
164	516	A small, little, almost gelatinous-looking creature...
160	140	that I developed over two seasons of fighting in the Octagon.
126	567	We-- we don't-- we don't have to talk.
112	24	So here's what we know about the Kraken.
142	506	I had the box in my hands, then I decided you never will. Ever.
111	486	Why is he looking at us?
158	288	l'll even throw in some hot chocolate with those little tiny marshmallows.
124	264	I-I am a terrible liar, Justin.
121	684	Sarah, come here. I want you to look at this. - What?
158	561	you'll be lucky enough to manage...
142	572	You thinking about sticking around for a while?
111	322	So Mrs. King is coming up the stairs with her groceries, and the shooter's here... ...and he takes her out before she has a chance to witness anything.
125	327	No, no, I don't. I like him the exact right amount for some one who I just met this morning.
124	682	We already did last time we were here. How do you think I found you?
144	746	Every cop, sheriff's deputy, and meter maid in the country will be up your ass unless you do exactly what our friend wants.
119	381	Smart. Or better yet, have a -- have a friend call your cell phone like 15 minutes into the date.
126	223	Nora. - I don't know. I started to think it was all a dream-- Whatever we were.
118	407	Yes, I put vinegar in the water. I do know how to poach an egg.
149	210	She could be anywhere. Uh, actually, I think we have a lead.
155	230	We can check you in under a fake name.
116	247	I'll be back. I'm just... gonna get a little air.
112	482	So what kind of damage could a Kraken hook do to a wood boat?
130	597	It doesn't matter what he thought.
132	333	Thank you. - Hey, no problem.
113	941	blood of my heart, my tide, my moon...
144	163	Bailey's testimony could cut the head off their organization, and they know it.
132	555	I gotta get back up to my floor, but congratulations.
131	565	I'm feeling very unc, so... Good night.
116	183	A-actually, it's-- it's kinda crazy you should say that. Um...
125	440	Um, e man and woman play their parts, but...
158	307	Since when does a washing machine need an L. C.D. screen?
136	286	Well, you know, we're making money.
137	144	It's gonna totally revolutionize the golf club -- forget it.
158	128	l'm not really dressed for a job interview right now.
150	53	Which is why there's nothing quite so unsettling as seeing one of those secrets show up in the wrong place at the wrong time.
138	57	But you don'thave to evacuate. You just have to... stay here with me.
155	434	But the fact is, Tom Card called an unsanctioned hit, and my brother was collateral damage.
146	395	They were talking about this boat. - yeah, I rember the name skylark ii.
144	465	Cole! Get out of the water!
114	139	What's the saddest thing you've ever seen?
153	209	If they haven't been spotted yet, they've broken the perimeter.
142	48	If there's one thing Nate Westen knows how to do, it's avoid telling the truth.
116	600	And while we can't diminish the seriousness of what their children are going through, we can ease their financial burden a bit and give them a friendly, safe place to stay.
161	349	Excuse me. I need you to get to class.
146	48	I should run. - Yeah? Super-secret spy meeting?
156	102	Honey, I need you to help me.
127	206	Do you remember the meeting I took - with the institute for republican thought?  - An oxymoron, but, yes.
146	104	Okay. Good. That's what I’ll tell my friend.
112	134	Attached to the rudder of the boat?
116	608	Fear keeps us doubting instead of hoping, looking down instead of up, and this evening is all about looking up, so look down only long enough to fill out your contribution form.
116	384	Fruit and vegetables are my life. You look great.
117	153	She just offered us a way to save ourselves.
160	32	But I didn't-- - [ Indistinct ]
113	367	You plan on being a writer?  - I don't know yet. Maybe.
156	56	You were the one who roped her into dealing with the Russian bureaucrat to help free Sonya, and she crushed it, by the way.
132	571	Well, of course you're terrified. It's a big step.
112	275	I have no idea how they did it.
145	591	My way of doing things doesn't work for the boy scouts.
151	185	I knew I should have shot that fisherman.
112	209	Nobody's ever seen one of these hunt.
155	959	Riley knows that I'm hurt, so she's going to be watching the hospitals to see if I turn up.
158	331	What can l say? l am a pathetic disaster, and l give up.
116	401	Have I ever said no to putting goop on my face? Come on.
119	639	It's the enemy out there, not in here.
127	48	Justin, I know you go to your N. A. Meetings and you talk about everything, and I think that's great.
114	88	Live forever. Forget what you've forgotten.
119	616	Yes, he is handsome, and you know what?
144	41	That makes him my teammate on this.
151	48	When you need to capture a target in a building, one of the most effective techniques is known as the hammer and anvil.
115	526	And now you sound like dad.
148	509	You wait for my signal and then you move.
116	228	And if I somehow gave cancer the opportunity to grow inside my body, then I have a responsibility to change.
163	249	Usually in cases like this we wouldn't expect to find them alive.
160	460	so we still feelin' pretty good about this, uh, 3 2-piece set here?
136	21	Lots of chances to get seen.
123	259	Justin sets his mind on something... it doesn't matter how wrong it is...
130	330	look, I don't care if you're working. Holly's more important.
113	1023	to get him an invitation on account of his...
144	709	We might have if Cole hadn't gotten away.
120	164	Paige, go upstairs and--and take that off.
142	333	We got a situation. Mike's in trouble.
125	678	I wanted to say that you were right to tell Paige.
130	216	It's got interests in local newspapers, radio.
146	301	You weren't kidding. Your guy's got skills. I’ll pick up the boat this afternoon.
116	109	No. He's talking about hard-working white people.
164	485	Once the insulated lower layers get warm enough...
134	285	If you want to kill a streetlight without the mess and inconvenience of breaking into the pole with a cutting torch, you need to access the circuit breaker.
126	568	You can just yell at me.
137	556	This is not the chart house.
157	623	Doesn't matter who you are --CIA, FBI -- we can find you and kill youjust the same.
160	296	Are you serious? - I'm dead serious.
145	183	Hush, now. Talking is only gonna make it hurt worse.
161	528	You're dead.  - I'm sad.
126	323	Dressed as a wizard, don't forget. - And Justin's there, too.
152	221	You just lawyer up, shut your mouth.
120	703	What do you think? - Oh, my god.
124	15	One of my brothers is the donor.
140	668	I got to say, it feels good to do this myself.
149	133	Don't - sir. Please. This is delicate high-end product.
137	562	Some people prefer the gas tank.
158	683	One time l helped an old lady across the street. Next day, l found a hundred-dollar bill.
126	73	I'm-- I'm-- I'm sorry. Are you sure-- five out of five?
155	60	This is about what your friends and your family get.
132	257	The chances of that happening are just about zero.
155	907	I don't know, but... it sounds like they didn't come alone.
117	717	It just goes round and round. And I know where it ends up...
154	379	Sam, I got an idea. Give me a hand.
155	1165	we'll find Westen and we will finish this.
145	332	If I don't give it to you, they're going to kill me.
117	463	What is it that you want to see...
141	167	Oh, I don't know. This charity stuff's new to me.
115	580	Sarah, guess what? Robert doesn't want to have children.
124	198	Y--just take his shirt off. - You know-- you know what? I'll-- I'll get it, Nora.
125	635	One, two, three. one, two, three. One, two, three.
117	346	W - why is it that no one will just say whatever it is they have to say?
134	332	No, I-I got stuffto answer to here. I got a life here.
132	188	Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine. Thanks for asking.
141	249	Yeah, right. The guy was a model marine. He was in for 20 years.
144	169	Lady pulling her patio furniture in saw Bailey a few miles from the safe house.
148	124	They're white-collar guys, Mike. It's a cakewalk.
164	435	is based on the life that we know...
129	130	Well, thank you,'cause I could really use the compa.
124	677	You know, I know where I can get some great linens on sale.
139	391	You need to act "businessas usual" until it's over.
114	5	I'm Sally, hi. - She's a ghost.
148	138	Oh, since you put it that way --no! Okay?
113	642	No matter how much money you have.
155	1151	The plan was no more meetings.
134	49	It's 40% aloe vera. They say it's great for burns.
164	37	we will embark on a fantasy safari...
122	544	I'll go get your stuff. - Thanks.
156	122	It's really all gone, isn't it?
156	89	Maybe, but it means walking into an Op completely in the dark.
131	623	Well, don't you think, as the guest, maybe it was up to you to adjust to their dynamic rather than the other way around?
118	595	They're shots across the bow from a guy named Stanton.
116	92	And you weren't the one who was so jacked up on prednisone that you got up at 3: 00 in the morning and cleaned up the kitchen.
119	474	This is -- this is ken.
153	361	No, we just need to speak with him.
145	521	Please, we just have to go to where they are.
140	527	It's Eddie. We need to meet now.
151	394	Oh, uh, she's... a friend of a friend.
121	155	You know, Luc never mentioned he's half-portuguese.
114	262	Are you gonna let me out?
137	104	Well, that part of the world, it's probably heroin.
126	536	What did you say your name was - Roy.
160	100	Since when, Kip? You have the worst reflexes of all time.
142	94	Michael, we covered this. The picture?
142	180	Mike? - Yeah, I don't have a lot of time.
163	253	Otherwise, he would've done it at the chamber's house.
163	502	Your daughters are best friends, and you all have known each other most of your lives as friends.
161	447	Even this, with you three ganging up on me, is not... I don't...
120	747	Your best days are not behind you.
119	383	Wow. Yeah, that -- that's not obvious at all.
137	911	So, this is Sam's storage locker. Phew!
142	251	His name's Jonathan Carver, a man with the right clearance at the right company, and the only employee who doesn't have a family, a dog, or an ADT account.
153	337	Because I'm not gonna let Sam take the fall for something I did.
137	552	This guy's just having some fun with us.
144	744	And this could be you. Public enemy number one.
115	835	Look, Scotty Jason is coming back.
153	130	Any idea where he went? - Yeah, I heard him run down the stairwell.
157	381	I mean, there's not too many Russian restaurants next to a caf? Across from a deli.
125	233	You support her back, keep your balance, because we're gonna dip.
153	39	We can do things, Michael - great things, necessary things.
111	498	For more drugs. No, I want you to admit that you used me.
123	218	Does this mean you'll help? - Of course.
133	51	I was always taught "never take yogurt from strangers.
123	92	He has to make up his own mind. - Yes, but you can help him with that.
150	414	Wait. W-what happened. W- what's going on?
161	56	No. You still have five minutes before the next class.
129	505	I will be finished with this any day now.
117	396	No one is allowed to drink my wine until everything is in the oven. Right now we're behind schedule.
132	430	Look jonathan, don't know what you want from me.
120	170	I've been through this before, twice.
154	382	Then get a couple of the guys and go find something that will get the job done.
115	525	Yeah, but then it would be a lie. -exactly.
131	420	Yeah, well, what about the chick who was choking on the mozzarella stick?
141	61	Well, I missed working with you, man.
119	496	Know what? -- No. Calm down.
161	170	I'll see you tonight?  - Okay.
163	193	Come on, I got some tissue in the office.
136	326	We are leaving. We are leaving! -Okay, jesus, ow.
116	135	Saul, we gotta do something. The Ojai revenues are in free fall.
118	258	Mom, mom, what... What are you doing?
131	70	The chicken really is to die for.
146	567	Maybe, but you made it right. - barely.
111	527	I told them to stop, and that's when they freaked out.
147	99	So, where does that leave us? - Square one.
145	148	You don't have to tell me about fighting.
163	305	They're all turning on each other.
112	460	And what we got a sense of is the size and shape and sort of just how nasty they would look on a full-size animal.
137	1014	Call me when you find the girl.
131	476	Yeah, about 20, descending on you at the same time, because that makes it so much easier to bond with.
154	285	Jesse, when you said a getaway vehicle, I wasn't thinking of a dump truck.
161	162	You know, I haven't been on a lot of dates, and I really don't know the way this is supposed to work, because we kind of skipped that part.
117	124	She called me twice already this morning.
140	204	It blocks a wide spectrum of radio frequencies, preventing people from detonating bombs by remote control.
162	153	It's gonna be OK, I promise.
141	144	I have to find out, and I need your help.
156	168	Um, what possible reason could you have for wanting all that?
148	108	Do we know what they're after? - No. No.
132	466	And think of how much fun it would be if we got to spend every day together like this.
130	200	Forget it. - No, don't forget it.
113	14	loving a girl who doesn't exist.
117	275	Does he know I found out about Aaron?
112	27	Well, I mean, these are our basic three culprits here:
164	595	one day humans may, in fact, become the machines.
151	451	Hello? - Yeah. Mike, it's me.
153	53	I was right outside that door, Mike.
130	297	There is a lot of sensitivity in that area.
134	226	Uh, can I talk to you?
164	376	this is what you would see that would rule the planet.
130	48	You're on speaker with me, the shopping twins, and Evan.
155	1321	When something goes wrong in the intelligence world
140	392	Eddie. What do I do to thieves?
130	647	That's the problem, because I can't promise the same about... changing.
161	466	There, you satisfied? And I didn't kill anyone with a drill bit.
164	113	But as the achoms scavenge through the dirt for food...
132	239	Okay, my friend, mid - morning cocktail.
115	150	Who told you? -Rebecca. And you?
145	221	Let's go! Move it! Get your sorry ass in there now!
123	538	I'm not here to get into the middle of your relationship with robert.
154	612	You try anything, I put a bullet in the back of his head.
160	313	I reckon you know a lot about cyberspace.
127	569	Okay, well, is this helping, the dancing?
149	274	Have fun, you two. You about ready?
130	551	You just... you need someone to listen.
118	626	Good. Let's call, and I'll sit right here with you.
142	219	This job is all I got, and if I miss a child-support payment, my ex is gonna take the kids to Flag staff with her boyfriend.
153	129	Some psycho just zonked Norm. I came around the corner. He was gone already.
164	594	But instead of merging with the machines...
118	252	I want you to give it to Kitty, and she'll make the decision on what to do.
126	743	Well, I was talking to Marilyn on the phone yesterday,
111	343	Well, he helps us find killers, like the person who hurt Maya.
127	159	No, y... yeah. I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't want to worry you.
156	641	Sam, what the hell are you doing, man?
146	491	How? I’m going to find out!
160	465	Tryin' to ruin my life and make me look like a friggin' idiot?
126	696	I almost cost Paige her honorable mention yesterday
148	573	Okay, fi, we got two cop cars and four plainclothes officers sitting on Dixon's computer lab.
111	499	What is this? Who are you looking at? Are you wearing a wire?
150	526	Michael! What is going on out there?
162	1803	A heart of fire, that one.
120	469	Thanks to you, Paige hates me.
162	1084	Did I say, "big brains"? Maybe I should qualify that, Mr Coot.
139	134	Well, your boy Trevor -- he's running with some pretty impressive company.
162	1454	Piss off, Mikey! Let a man do one thing right, at least.
158	177	You know where the broom is. Yeah. l'll－
164	3	Now, see further than we've ever imagined...
150	587	She said this is the only way to end it. She left that for you, Mike.
136	374	I'll get it over there tonight and plant it.
125	99	The agency, the egg donor, uh, doctors
122	110	We don't want to overwhelm him.
162	1571	Only good for one thing, they are.
153	98	Okay, I need you to meet me in the north side alley.
161	504	You're a jackass and a dirtbag.
128	710	Real is real. It's paint colors and temper tantrums and...
156	60	Look, Michael, we are this close to the top of the pyramid.
118	288	What? - She said let it go.
115	576	Wow. A little late for that kind of information.
128	159	You know, her husband was just killed by an i. e.d.
118	32	Saul and Scotty are doing their restaurant menu up in ojal.
127	41	What, spent the entire dinner talking about my miscarriage?
122	182	Julia, will you let up on me a little? Please.
111	526	But as more time went on, they just were trying to change my mind.
128	509	You have to say it. - Oh, yeah, sorry. To win it, bro.
155	716	I'll have to explain later. right now, I -- don't bother.
115	593	You're about to drag my brother.
154	241	You -- you can hold them off, right?
152	454	You talk to her right here.
144	268	The downside is it doesn't include top-notch security, which can be a problem, unless you make your own line of defense.
134	177	I guess he even owns part of this golf club.
131	432	Yeah, he's pinned under the steering wheel. We're gonna have to cut him out.
146	233	His boss is going to have to remove him from the equation, you're off the hook, and Miami has one less sociopath to worry about.
120	356	Your sponsee, since when? - Since last night.
130	18	What more do you want from a handbag?
161	439	That I... That no one wanted me?  You don't want to hear that!
145	100	Ryoko's the V. P.of sales for Pacific Rim Industries.
116	432	You know what? If you guys want to keep on laughing at me, if you want to make fun of me, that's fine.
116	12	No. God, no. I need to get outta the house.
161	11	See "Grey's Anatomy" last night?  - Yeah.
119	614	Uh, my brother Kevin is smart and good and kind and generous and thoughtful -- -- handsome, don't forget handsome.
122	243	Let's start  with the mother-in-law.
124	386	You want to build a womb, like this home
161	635	T-Dog! Stop him!  - Fight! Fight!
158	104	What? A stranger's bacon. l thought it would sound better in French.
115	309	What's the longest relationship you've ever been in?
148	325	What's that? - These are his papers.
127	662	Take hands and repeat after me... I...
148	289	Why don't you let me handle this? I'll go over there, check it out.
155	543	I'm offering you answers to questions that have haunted you for 25 years, all for the incredibly low price of just one address.
130	35	She clearly needs help. - Oh, damn, damn, damn!
117	110	I hope so. And it would be really helpful if you would all call him and tell him how excited you are about the party tonight.
112	14	Steve Leonard is in the North Pacific, about to go diving for a giant sea creature that may hold clues to the Kraken.
134	366	What, you think Joey took the car?
156	630	Frakes detained Michael before he could plant the virus.
124	204	Scotty, don't be silly. It's nothing I haven't seen before.
155	391	I got blood all over my watch.
164	242	are going to have to somehow be shielded...
162	1024	I just had a look in that shed down the bottom, full of worthless old junk. Ik ben net in die schuur met oude troep gaan kijken.
111	100	If you want to deprive me of that... -- I do.
140	331	There's nothing in the world easier to get into than an empty condo that's been on the market for six months.
117	163	Roast squab with wild rice stuffing, mango chutney...
125	219	Um, I'm sayin', I can really help you out, man, if you know, we don't want to keep you from your swim.
140	722	That's how it works, right, Victor?
159	3	Not sure I like that, David. - It was you who started this fantasy game.
140	530	Before, you said you could move cash o-offshore?
150	214	We just- - I was at cifa. You know what cifa is?
117	271	Guys, this isn't a road trip. No, it's a business trip, and ojal is a family business, so let's let York see that.
123	88	No. No, I don't think you're gonna have to crawl.
154	573	No! No! I would never -- I would never do that!
161	71	I have sixth period free.  - Sixth period? Okay.
111	297	Here. And then you, uh, press the center button and you toggle the left switch. We are... online.
120	541	I flirted with you 30 years ago to piss my husband off and now here you are, picking me up off the dance floor.
162	1507	There are so many wings here.
134	503	And that place was rented a week ago in cash by mr. Chuck finley.
134	187	Mike, I don't know. This is a tough one.
161	1	All first-time subs have it. Welcome to McKinley!
149	213	Sam, you get ready to pull Jesse and Resnik out.
116	117	You don't ignore a guy like that, Kevin. You beat him into submission.
122	421	You wanna fill your mom in?
147	344	How do I even know any of this is true?
129	234	Oh, just... Just-just stay and eat.
146	285	It should be empty tomorrow morning. Sam just swapped out the boats up in boca.
159	419	No. Let's just do it my way.
139	220	Tell him I'll meet him tomorrow.
136	622	I’m not cleaning up your mess.
147	563	How's that for something you can feel, Mr. Vanderwall?
123	230	I always wanted to be a dancer. - No problem.
113	1185	And yet, you believe that what you feel...
141	416	And you don't want your little loved one here to be paws up next to the water bowl, - so... - Paco?
154	450	Trying to physically stop one requires using an object heavy enough to stop its linear momentum.
146	606	But look at this. There are just a lot of inconsistencies.
127	294	And the person who was there from the very beginning - was Dennis York.  - Right.
152	42	So, start an investigation of your own.
141	588	Larry just sprayed Jeannie's fork with something.
113	850	You know that's a lie!  - I want you out of here.
114	100	Is my energy or whatever so awful?
162	1251	Anyone says they're cold, they can run round the field three times.
130	120	I-I would love to whittle. I need to whittle.
124	693	Well, it's not that weird. I mean, you're gay.
158	249	So, you think maybe, uh, you'd want to go to coffee later...
114	140	Um... the parents who have children in here.
117	492	Holly, I would never do that.
141	66	You want me for a job? - Yes.
146	36	You doing all right, bro? - Nate, why'd you move back to Miami?
142	115	So, this is the house where the Michael Westen grew up, huh?
146	371	You know, I changed my mind. I’m going to move back to Vegas.
115	546	I'm gonna go get some more wine, and maybe you would like to help me, Robert?
112	312	So, if a Kraken thinks it's a whale and it eats whale, how huge is this thing?
160	26	Hey, Napoleon, what'd you do all last summer again?
144	668	You're running out of time, Cole!
153	160	First of all, I'd like to thank you for your bravery in there.
155	136	Yeah, hang on a second, pal.
146	590	I was at the horseshoe, because I was up 700 bucks, and I couldn't leave the table.
126	583	So my science project was all about your dorkiness
138	147	When you see that Charlie'ssafe, give me the signal.
112	416	Steve and I are in a research lab in Wellington, looking for some wicked weapons to add to our Kraken.
141	49	Uh, correct me if I'm wrong, but you're dead.
119	662	Okay, this is us. All right, do or die. Let's go.
147	153	A high-ranking mercenary with a group called Optimal Outcomes.
115	16	Why don't you tell me why you're really here?
155	269	Could you, uh, hook me up with a diet dr pepper?
118	265	At the four seasons. - Th... Mother.
153	219	You have fallback plans, rally points.
128	136	That's the issue for me, is if I get on the wrong side of stanton, her campaign will be the first casualty.
131	240	Last thing you want is a bunch of sharps flying out at 65 mis per, unless you're a ninja, I guess.
112	281	Our Kraken has to be truly massive to sink it.
132	40	Saul, Saul, don't! You'll throw your back out. - I got it.
142	359	Great, but we need to go. Now.
146	409	And you better pray you're right, because somebody's going to be eating a bullet.
154	533	Wait, wait, wait. It's Vanek. It's Vanek.
137	262	I knew it. - You did not.
155	595	Schmidt's phone has a scrambler, but we'll only have a minute to let dean stay on the line before the CIA gets a lock on us.
128	340	Look, mom, I told you... - I know, Sarah. I know.
145	607	I like my life, and I want to live it with you -- here.
126	274	Does she know I'm failing out of medical school? No.
161	828	I am so glad I did not go to my sister's birthday party!
113	782	Must be love.  - Oh.
144	327	It's just you and me on this one.
122	91	You know what? You should not be driving and talking on your cell at the same time.
125	708	Well, thank you, Cooper. I don't feel like I'm sick.
124	427	See--see, I can-- I can't do this.
123	222	It was the same color as that karmann ghia that tony campbell used to drive.
130	437	She did, uh, leave this note.
138	608	You tell Carla someone elsewent after her operatives, and we're friends, the kind of friends who don't go bowling, don't go for beers, don't even really speak...
130	259	Um, oh, look, have you seen my keys?
111	603	First, I was bored out of my mind, but then this X Files marathon came on. Have you guys seen this show?
123	336	You hate golf. - I don't hate golf.
147	583	That truck was supposed to be delivered to a rival of mine.
134	112	You don't understand, man! I have to
163	238	So, the car's left in town where it would eventually be found.
111	442	A text, an e-mail? -- No.
123	427	The lobster ravioli in a meyer lemon and butter emulsion on a bed of sauteed baby watercress...
150	74	Ruined your life? I gave you a life, Michael.
152	298	They're talkative, eager to please, and most meet too many people in a given year to remember them all.
153	75	Fi, how we looking? - Not good.
142	161	Spies are trained to use whatever resources are available.
148	406	So instead of finishing my prime rib and garlic mashed potatoes, here I am with you jackasses --that's what's up.
114	216	I guess. You get used to it.
132	154	You wanted to nora Walker me into going to new york.
148	174	I got to know -You're gonna push some buttons on a computer when I tell you to.
128	27	Narrow lake... - What's going on?
164	288	At first sight, you might almost mistake a moblant for a starfish.
146	227	I know it sounds scary, but we can still make it work.
113	169	You're Ethan Wate?  - Yeah.
129	271	If there's one thing America likes, it's an underdog.
156	513	Barry, I know you're going through a lot right now.
123	646	God, you're mixing your dickens. It was a goose, dumb-ass.
115	451	Because this doesn't smell right, and I don't want to get blamed for toasty rice.
162	637	You don't have to worry, Dad. Not any more.
158	28	lt looked like it came out of the rear end of an elephant. [Groans]
120	559	I've been this--in this black hole of greenatopia, completely ignored the rest of my life.
141	659	I can't tell you how many timesI've been working, and I just
159	5	I wonder what my father would say if he knew an embassy counselor was fantasizing sex in the courtroom?
115	286	How's he doing? -On what happened, but I stand by.
120	206	Well, thank you. That--yeah, that's good.
130	166	Because I don't know how many more times I can apologize or watch you come and go to your office, completely ignoring me.
122	573	I don't think I'm gonna be able to eat with everyone staring at me.
148	234	You're a pro. you do a head count...
118	57	Not everything. I mean, you still have Narrow Lake.
151	46	Yeah. I'm taking Elsa to dinner tonight.
134	451	When you push someone to the point of desperation, there's always a chance they'll go looking for help, which could be a problem...
163	121	Hope we haven't brought you folks out here for nothing.
137	1254	Um, I -- I called home to check messages, but I used the secure phone that you gave me.
154	427	Yeah, well, hope Vanek feels the same way.
155	183	End of the hall. goes into the employee parking lot.
125	194	There's a whole lot of protocol about the first dance.
153	506	M-dub! I'm getting suited and booted. What's crackin', super spy?
122	364	Saul, this is lena, uh, the new office manager.
155	512	Michael, have you completely lost it?
124	421	This is a perfect moment for us to put our collective foot in his ass about getting his act together.
121	468	Where's Nora? - Yes. Tell her to come and dance with us.
161	738	You're the bitch!  - Huh?
129	487	Luc... I messed up. I’m really sorry.
137	1251	Nate, you make any calls today?
151	387	Um, you don't know me. Ayn sent me. I'm here
113	232	Now，you stop it.  - I pray you protect us from all things evil.
137	638	These are very serious people, okay?
147	106	Anywhere Cahill goes, nastiness usually follows.
111	406	I thought I'd get a jump on it. Nice. You find anything interesting?
163	483	His arrest was a sunder standing, ok?
125	486	Well, I was going to handle it before you sent me over to the house to handle Luc.
122	192	I can't believe this. I mean, I know we haven't talked in a while, but it's like you have a whole new family.
116	323	Rebecca, that's what they say to-- - Justin, I don't have cancer.
161	571	No, what the hell's the matter with you guys?
118	311	Mom, why did you sleep on the floor?
132	460	I think I really do help a lot of people.
127	506	We're trying to stop him.  - 10-45.
125	217	My--my grandmother rana dance studio in Paris, and she made me dance with all those girls.
148	473	And I want you to sit down now!
134	515	You have to know when to give the target help and comfort...
129	120	I’m really sorry about your wife, man.
131	297	Let's not forget who won at horse.
150	112	He free lances for hostile governments in the middle east, finding assets willing to spy on the u. S.
128	160	I think I should probably cook something.
130	438	Sorry I had to leave."I forgot I promised my friend Amy I'd do her toenails".
142	520	Since we last met, I became an expert on Tyler Brennen.
116	126	I-I-it's-- it's Pratical w-why are you so amped up, anyway?
119	441	Oh, sweetie, you remember Donna? -- Sure.
141	508	Sounds like Bill Johnson's got a date.
148	241	He hid in the can and called the cops.
142	60	You wouldn't happen to know where I could find a burned spy, would you?
115	308	Can I ask you something? -Shoot.
165	182	You know what you've done here, Robinson?
152	364	You know what? That's a good thing.
154	339	And then,"bip, bip, bip! " Better than disco.
129	434	Nora Walker, snap out of it right now.
115	280	Private first class john jimpson, sir.
161	624	Why don't you just leave them alone?
113	775	Why don't you escort your under-dressed friend into the dining room?
145	149	My girlfriend, she'll just explode. I mean, if I'm looking at another woman, she…
126	90	And a degree without a license is meaningless.
125	459	Oh, when we have an argument.
146	366	Well, now we got to bring in our friend jesse. Get him in place.
129	6	Um... You know, honey, I don't really have anything planned.
132	476	She can't stop the placement, but she stole his wallet.
134	218	Well, I got to say, Erik Luna's gota nice little scam going.
122	262	Nobody's calling anybody. - Pull over.
132	299	My - I haven't even told him that I'm going yet.
148	369	When he lands, Holcomb's gonna kill his security team and kidnap him.
126	758	Marilyn invested a very large sum of money in one of Simon's causes
145	361	Okay, now, if we play this right, Takeda's gonna ask you to contact his crew.
163	366	Cause don swore it was a one-time thing.
130	176	Well, I hadn't seen you guys in quite some time, so I told Sarah that I would really love to bring Paige over.
153	285	either with a slap on the wrist or with life in prison.
132	340	Why don't you, uh, why don't you just tell me what happened?
122	351	Listen, you're an old friend of Rebecca's, holly gave you a glowing recommendation...
125	38	And with a flash, it explodes.
144	568	No more questions. No more secrets.
113	383	get three DUI's and lose my job.
154	80	You sure we can't buy these passport chips somewhere else?
115	190	Not that I, you know, want anybody to find out or anything, but seriously, what.
163	209	Looks like chief yates won himself a title back in the day.
147	404	Well, that's still 5 guys with machine guns. - Better than 40.
136	140	This is the new me, Michael...for now.
162	1430	And tell him from me to keep on dancing.
117	721	Oh, wait, wait, wait. While we're up here, let's make our official toast. Oh, no, no. Let me, let me, let me.
152	85	They never wanted to get to the bottom of it.
164	343	To find out, we lift off from the strong gravity of AG-143...
142	131	You really want to find out what questions she has for his dear old money-laundering pal Barry?
160	450	She's at a friend's house right now. - [ Rico ] Well, hey, Napoleon.
148	600	See, I --I-I knew we should've surrendered.
129	105	Who's here. - Uh, were you guys just working out?
145	182	I'll kill you! - In you go.
155	1220	The boat that belongs to the people that's trying to kill us.
113	1256	I mean, look at this. This is, like, pathetic. This ain't Christmas, heh.
131	27	He's got me working a double today, so...
135	390	Look, I know you wantto get back to jared.
151	197	Oh, well, Ed's my boss. I'm just borrowing it.
130	112	What if I make a mistake? It's... it's just huge.
155	329	How is your day going to end?
120	431	Uh, yeah. If I were Arlo, I'd be taking out my checkbook right now.
158	540	Oh! We're so late. Come on! Come on! Oh, my gosh!
140	520	As part of the projection process, they emit x-rays.
131	598	That'd be great. - Yeah. That would be great.
146	277	Dude, I’m messing with you, bro. I put it under the rear wheel well.
153	613	Thanks, mom, but they'll be coming back. You still need to leave.
120	54	Well, that would've been okay, except it was at a tech conference and I'm supposed to be a "techie".
113	89	Just us. Oh, that would be just heaven. Heh.
140	89	But he was kind enough to help me install my home-theater system.
130	496	Is that... is that what you think?
122	145	and the women's republican thing. You begged me for it.
137	170	What is that --a name of a horse?
116	477	Hi. - Hey. Are you guys early?
155	1340	They were doing the same to me.
163	199	He who seeks the queen of all knowledge, speak and be recognize.
128	533	That'd be a prime waste of national resources.
112	74	Yeah, he's going to look for an exit and...
146	339	You got to at least admit that you're wrong.
152	288	Want one last look at the file before you approach Meyerson?
113	768	Ridley, my dear. What an unpleasant surprise.
137	1154	He's got a boat on the river near the 27th avenue bridge.
153	183	We can... we can use it.
132	522	And young, right? That's what you were gonna say. Young.
142	578	Nate, I know it's hard sometimes being my brother.
162	1703	You don't include me, you hardly talk to me, you never told me you wanted a baby, and now you're not telling me the truth!
117	296	What about your art stuff? Is that going in the same box?
150	453	I’m buying time. I can't let you do this - not yet.
165	519	If god could grant me one wish, it would be to deserve the opinion you have of me.
142	243	The guy in that house has a voice.
112	350	I'm seven stories up the main mast of the Soren Larsen and still climbing.
114	49	???? You've invited every neighbour I've ever hated to be a part of your neighbourhood watch.
154	298	Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I don't think you understand.
113	10	Until I realized that would be no great toss.
147	379	We can assume that Cahill's working with somebody, somebody with skills.
150	405	We promised Mike we'd talk to the cops and work this through.
111	549	And? And he's angry. Very angry.
115	545	I thought we were having a philosophical, theoretical discussion about a campaign that had information. -we were. We changed the subject.
141	475	A can of paint across the windshield could blind the driver.
139	450	That's not somethingyou "get around to," Sam.
122	219	You should come with me. I mean, I-I have to go there anyways today, so...
155	665	Cause if I don't, Jesse goes to jail forever, and I can't let that happen.
148	217	Now, I-I know some of you must be concerned that you've seen our faces.
111	376	Hell, I'd take you out for ten million.
118	55	Just one more piece. - Sarah.
118	353	Uh, nothing. Just a-a school question.
158	217	Hey. Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on.[stops]
153	81	If you need to escape a building that's being locked down, speed is key.
116	90	How do you know? - Kitty, stop. Please. You're frightening me.
128	657	Oh, I'm flattered. But we both lost the big game.
134	64	Listen, Michael, we all know what's at the topof your christmas list.
137	476	Mike was their first cleanup project.
134	154	Why do you think he'll get custody?
141	105	What -- you need my help, Lar? Is that it?
136	171	Cons do it for the money, and spies do it for the flag, but it's mostly the Sam e gig.
134	150	I'm not sure if fi counts, Mike.
151	330	I don't know what's up with Bill.
148	223	then I'm gonna be forced to use this.
145	503	So, your friends are in one of these warehouses?
130	184	Scotty, if... if it means this much to Paige,
127	444	I hear he's about to lose the finance chair, - so he might be a little sensitive on spending.  - Oh, Kevin?
126	745	Her daughter Rachel is the public defender in Orange county,
148	560	You want proof that I'm not with Marsden?
130	140	Wow. Well, that's the kind of friend we'd all like to have.
134	238	I-I think my mom is starting to get her hopes up.
163	312	You're the one going to Penn state.
140	593	I stole it from a coke dealer up in boca.
121	172	That's okay. It's better that way, - that I give him some air. - No, no, no, no, no, no.
118	531	I'm sorry. I saw the bottle on your desk, all right?
158	692	[Man] Hey! Shut the valve! The pipe is broken.
137	617	Use a code that's too simple, and it will get broken.
165	407	Robinson, this bible of yours, tell me the story.
132	359	Did you guys go to college together or something?
122	485	Is that meant to be sarcastic, mother?
122	124	Anyway, we'll do some quick photo ops with some local supporters at the airport and then...
115	506	It means nothing. Kitty, we're not.
126	313	See, a science project is about science. - I beg to differ.
112	253	Right, we may have to arm-wrestle over this.
114	513	Why not? That room is perfect.
149	43	It's supposed to look like an accident.
127	165	All right. You'll pop off a couple dozen rounds, show these folks you're handy with that 9, - and then we'll mosey on down to the clubhouse...  - Ugh.
154	135	I have an errand I have to run.
141	240	I'm late, but I come bearing gifts.
145	298	I prefer to live on the edge... Don't you?
128	268	It would be wonderful for the two of you to have some adult time, honey.
145	80	This is serious. Somebody came to me at work. There's a job.
118	421	How was the drive? - Oh, it wasn't bad.
141	44	Figure out what, I may get some leverage against Carla.
161	544	No, no, Wade. Drillbit must have done it.
119	307	You know, you just do things in a clump
141	648	Well, I better get going. But I got just one thing to say.
156	783	Barry, I heard about your ex.
145	293	I'm bored just hearing about it.
156	262	I'm passing the IPsec, sending you the I. P. address now.
156	146	It sends us their data and wipes their drives clean.
141	505	And this is it, right --no more games? I get my pension back?
151	177	Honestly, I just don't understand the guy's appeal.
112	476	You know what? You go ahead. Yeah. There you go.
150	163	Reed's on schedule. And satellite tracking has him headed your way.
127	284	Um, I've got to get back to work, but it's not like you need me there anyway.
162	1098	Well, it's better than history and physics.
158	533	l understand the drill－ keep them waiting－but the natives are getting restless.
148	434	I just want to know how the hell they found us in the first place.
147	427	Take it up with commander Jackson. He brought us here himself.
151	251	You have a collect call from an inmate at Allarod federal penitentiary.
139	340	Now, sit down. We're gonna go over a few things.
111	383	The thing is, his alibi checks out. I mean, I verified it myself.
131	54	Your eyes are even more magnetic in person.
141	551	After she's dead, Drew brings Larry the money, and that's when you're gonna...
155	1255	Most people don't think of the coast guard as being particularly well-armed.
162	451	My dad's sad, my mum's sad, you're sad.
124	581	Because my butt is killing me. - No.
130	678	So... mom's not here. You know, maybe she's not coming.
153	44	Then, even a seasoned operative will have the same response as everyone else
123	537	to be by his side and, uh, and to have given up some very real part of yourself, your own dreams, so that your mate can save the world.
122	407	the thing is, I-I kind of...
150	169	I don't want anyone getting hurt. - copy that.
134	612	Don't be too hard on him.
153	609	It's all right. I...pretended I was some helpless old woman.
154	138	I would like to go see Nate's grave one last time before we leave.
132	237	Yeah. - Good thing you brought that flashlight.
120	73	No, honey. I-- I'm--I'm too busy. I'm sorry.
137	586	Kent and Melissa are going to have a little, uh, well-documented transaction going on -- a buy.
115	411	I appreciate all of your opinions, but i've told you a million times, I will not win playing dirty.
120	479	And you completely overreacted to that little outfit.
141	108	Now, the whole idea here is that you will do this one solo, and that way, you can re-establish some kind of a trust with me.
127	413	Do you have my memo for the committee?  - Nope.
137	593	It's good. We're covered. Don't sweat it.
130	341	And she needs your help, man.
129	383	Futile, maybe, because you and your partner aren't able to have children biologically?
137	1208	I had a friend who deals in secondhand cars check it out.
148	424	No, no, no. All right, all right.
119	701	Oh, and just so you know, you're -- you're pretty much a -- an amateur when it comes to losing game night.
146	517	How the hell did you let him escape?
148	143	Sam! No! Oh, Fi. Fi! Fi.
118	758	Why don't you find something on the radio?
124	41	And, well, technically, she's my daughter 'cause I gave sperm to tommy and Julia.
117	496	Oh, my god. She's trying to buy us time.
142	113	Good, buddy. I'll see you soon. - All right.
125	603	And did grandma tell you that Kitty has the best doctors in the whole world, and they're doing everything they can to help her and that she's gonna be just fine?
113	46	I'm a junior now, Amma. If I dress like I care, I lose credibility.
137	1046	I think about it, I get, like, hives.
146	385	You got a cop tipping you off? - no, no, no, no, no, no.
159	285	No one's asked for any money.
148	551	Guys, you need to forget about the hostages. All right?
127	251	Well, come on. Before Sarah, I never had any good reason.  - Ooh.
155	998	We had a deal -- you surrender, you help with my investigation into this tom card mess.
142	499	How big do we want this?
136	296	If you've got a better wayto find encrypted passwords and account information, I’m all ears, baby.
127	601	I know. I kn... I had to do it.
158	195	What the－What is this? Oh. Flip it like that.
161	384	Then I got hit in the ear, which you probabIy can't even see,'cause it's so deep in the ear canal.
128	642	I know where this is headed. - Don't put words in my mouth.
160	97	Stay home and eat all the freakin' chips, Kip!
165	343	Not after the life you've come to know here.
129	526	You know, Catherine, most people consider a year to be the minimum waiting period.
129	576	Went to the worst possible version of you.
126	310	Why don't you turn it on?
142	446	You know, Nate, I'll bet Michael's thinking the same thing about you.
111	429	I was in my apartment. -- Shh, shh, shh. Milo.
117	388	I leave for ten minutes to get macadamia nuts, and it's like you take away her will to live.
111	506	I bet you're wearing a wire.
140	721	No. You know what you're meant to know.
148	422	Call the President of the United States of America.
124	705	There you go, honey. - Elizabeth...
117	123	She is in so much denial.
158	219	What's going on? Look, Jake. The Knitting Factory fell through.
149	89	Let me guess. You want me to stay here, watch Benny, see what he's up to - fine.
155	85	It's Broward p. d. they're coming down 75.
156	480	He buzzes around looking over everybody's shoulder to check their progress.
118	672	I probably should've a long time ago, but I think I...
122	679	Will you give him one message for me?
147	331	My men are under orders to shoot intruders on sight when they remember them.
141	125	Michael, I want you to meet my brilliant, adorableparamedic boyfriend, Campbell.
162	1132	I go once up and down the ward and three times round every landing.
124	360	I won't. I promise. I promise, I won’t. I love you. Yeah.
116	446	Uh-huh. Okay. So which one of them called you?
165	94	Well, it's the reason the sergeant called for an early landing and look where that got us.
112	339	But when you think about it within context that's when it sort of all comes together, the freakiness of the magnitude of what we're doing.
146	497	It's hard not to look where someone's firing, and gunshots are disorienting, especially at close range.
124	528	They're about Elizabeth, okay? I'm really sorry.
154	91	We're here for the chips -- the, uh, passport chips.
162	1166	That's weird, not going to school.
117	606	Well, now it's my turn to tell you that. Oh.
137	1298	That's what spies do, you know?
155	656	Oh, damn it. you know, that still hurts.
134	23	You know, it's not the same when no one's watching.
155	1309	5, 4... - all right, I'll call!
148	120	you know, like a 60ish-year-old woman sitting in a car.
146	225	They're dead, they can't sue nobody.
119	486	Oh. Okay, it -- -- I'm sorry.
117	736	Cake! Cake! Cake! We only just started eating.
155	506	You just need a clean car, something to get you close so they don't know it's you.
116	373	My god, children have to listen to you-- my children
123	194	you know, I'm... look, I'm sorry.
129	560	Catherine? - I have to go, mom.
151	60	Don't tell me what I need. I'm calling the shots here.
145	275	I haven't really explored Miami very much.
111	226	Dion? What, you mean the video games and stuff?
117	154	For reasons I don't understand, you turned her down.
119	150	Yeah, u did. -- I did not.
162	813	Can't give up, Mum. Mustn't ever give up. Gotta fly!
155	796	I have a little medical bag to stitch minor wounds and pull splinters.
121	593	I... I'm not gonna tell you what you should do, but maybe you can think about who she is now.
115	634	Thank you. Tell 'em we're having dinner in here. They might want to join us.
113	510	Whoa, can you make anything grow?
130	684	She's not gonna kill me in public. Smile.
112	49	Octopuses are notoriously crafty and elusive.
113	236	She did it!  - It was her!
113	98	She looks like death eating a cracker.
137	424	What do you think I do, mom?
113	289	You ever see the movie?  - No.
125	288	Oh, Scotty, Rebecca, what brings you here?
164	106	and they lift right out of the water...
125	103	Are you guys thinking what I'm thinking?
153	188	When I shot Card, it wasn't in self- defense.
128	400	Don't get cocky. - Nice shot.
163	93	Both calls made were made from Brooke's cell, which has since been turned off.
156	410	It's more like $45, 000 now.
150	295	Listen, Jake, this is not a job with a great future.
164	575	To better understand the origin of an alien planet teeming with these types of machines...
162	252	That's weird, not going to school.
125	24	Okay, don't leave till my exdrives out of the driveway. I'll call you.
148	630	I'll call Marsden out. - I'll tell him...
115	464	No. -So don't criticize people who are.
119	289	You just -- you just cheered us right up.
141	564	How? - By serving him up for me.
156	289	Okay, that's Fi. Throw the switches.
132	142	great. This is all I need.
134	119	I can only cook a few things, and the air-conditioning's iffy.
119	252	But now it just seems so surreal.
112	293	Okay, guys, the plan is to get under the boat and have a good
162	129	You think too much. Sometimes you've just gotta...
126	479	Mom, just-- - And this is him here. I'm gonna take the call.
140	537	Luckily, you can usually count on the other guy not to let you off easy.
122	94	He likes this shirt, doesn't ?
120	335	If that happens, we just flush 'em ourselves.
117	710	I didn't know that she really wanted to.
114	96	Um... Let's just say that we evolved.
148	165	Someone who just joined the team won't expect an equal cut of whatever you're stealing, and if they don't know your plans, they can't go to the cops.
161	208	You didn't take that to Home Ec, too, did you?
127	163	We're not gonna let Luc go without a great big fight.  - Four weeks?
129	347	Uh, well, Dr. Alex, I appreciate that kind of diligence, but not every mother has the time.
130	32	Sarah, she's your kid. So why don't you help her?
165	225	At least I can bear my own exile a while longer, knowing how Susannah's been safe in your care.
146	346	So now you can accuse Carter of being an undercover cop.
162	226	He was a lovely little boy... like you.
148	427	Please stand by to redirect to Fort Lauderdale. Over.
128	18	Oh, she's doing a girl scout camping weekend.
150	359	We drive off, we hand over Reed to the interrogators, and you go to work.
130	111	Oh, God. You know, I'm sitting on tens of millions of dollars and trying to find the right company to buy into or buy out.
117	162	I'm not giving up. I'm making some calls.
117	402	Right now, I'm gonna chop these, and nothing on earth is gonna stop me.
131	118	I know. I know. It always rings.
120	231	Who's Arlo? - I'm sure he's there every day for lunch.
132	332	Hey, rick appleton. - Justin Walker.
156	582	Staircase and hallway downstairs are clear.
130	284	Or did you not? - I don't... I don't remember a plan.
132	650	Olivia, do you think you could look at us when we talk to you?
129	657	Neither of us should be, because we are happy, and we're in love, and... Did you hear mom on the radio today?
157	131	Hopefully, we'll track the guy back to where the girls are before Katya gets her hand son a blowtorch.
144	535	You said Miami beach, right? That's where we're headed?
153	556	Damn it, Fuller! What's taking so long?
136	431	I swear to god, if I find out you're lying to me -This might not be what it looks like.
153	298	That's not the question, Mr. Axe.
152	90	Uh, I did some poking around the FBI.
131	199	Paparazzi? My god. The world has gone mad.
115	533	Please, Nora, this is a million times more fun than politics, and I'm not even following it.
111	566	I'm gonna call the movers, get our stuff back, and you got to call work.
145	357	Because I think I can get him to talk.
116	642	Robert, it's gonna be like a fatwa. Checks will fly.
121	411	Luc never mentioned anything to me about a film.
130	7	This is Dr. Karl West. Thanks for listening.
162	759	Then perhaps... you'll have a brother or sister after all.
114	528	Debbie Rinaldi, the stupid love of my dumb-ass wasted life.
123	524	We jt went straight to being lovers, then fighters.
145	204	Michael, you're gonna be outside with your gun, and you've got the man shackled to the bed, for God's sake.
161	449	You were in the miIitary, huh?  Tell me where you served.
128	348	Sarah, I have to tell you, I think this game is a problem.
138	115	Sam, why would you --  - I didn't have time to do itany other way.
116	663	These people are freaks of nature.
151	479	Where the hell's the - what are you looking for?
144	442	I'll try, but for now I need a way to find Bailey.
150	107	Do I get to know what it is? -  Well, I guess you probably should...
125	88	Um, I'm sure Scotty told you, uh, we--we want to have a baby.
128	698	You know, he used to…come and cuddle and fall asleep and...
163	143	What kind of history? - Depression.
161	34	You want some hot coffee?  - Only in the worst way.
142	306	Sounds like Brennen's after some government-funded weapon.
124	658	Here you are. Not too light. Not too dark. Just right.
137	179	I need some backup, and Mike's mind is pretty much on this whole Cowan business.
125	348	I-I've been going over all these expenses from the wedding.
126	402	I googled him again. There's this picture of him from some Boca Raton society page.
148	689	And maybe it's in this box.
117	131	And as of next week, the bank is gonna seize this land and the building.
126	135	It's bad business, But it is the Walker way.
153	87	The elevators, P.A. system, and security cameras belong to me now.
126	427	Oh, yes, of course. Well, that's obvious. Terrific work, Justin.
144	179	Just how much sushi-grade yellowtail has to be ruined before I can file an insurance claim?
133	501	I got -- I got people who report to people who report to people.
147	28	Do I know him? - No.
160	124	A must-have for this season's fashion.
163	518	And a location. Downtown north mammon, within 100 meters of the intersection of main and first.
164	209	What would an alien look like?
137	1320	The fact is a commando is just someone trained to fight under a specific set of circumstances.
127	381	We've gotta go to city hall.  - We have to go to city hall.
152	243	Stay put, Mr. FBI man, or I'll blow your head off.
121	342	I can't believe I'm actually standing here, - talking to the Gabriela Laurent. - Oh.
161	568	Yeah.  - My God, this guy knows where we live.
165	236	I don't know what they talked about.
163	482	We let him coach our girls.
161	715	We did it, we did it!  - We did.
130	359	Well, it's...it's not like I sit around picturing you.
127	35	Well, th... the thing is, he's free tonight.
142	403	A two-man security team. Unfortunately, you can't go around them.
135	476	Well, you set upfor your photo shoot here. I'll be sunbathing over therein a hat.
128	95	You know, with... with the big taps.
120	47	And I think you're being a tad melodramatic.
142	384	Yeah. - Life is too short.
140	584	It's an accountant named Ricky watkins.
145	606	It is a new job, Fi, but it's not a new life.
162	576	Dad. It's really late. You've been working all day.
127	425	Your job.  - Robert, I feel trapped.
163	383	At the exact time the other girls were leaving their scripted messages, he was at the pep rally.
160	30	What kind of gun did you use? - A frickin' 1 2-gauge. What do you think?
142	526	But if you want to makea quick phone call, put your mind at ease, I'll wait.
113	328	And it's not my fault that I have a predilection for good breeding...
152	59	No. I just need you to tell me everything you know about this case.
142	101	Prove to me I'm not wasting my time.
124	31	Look at you, sweetie. My goodness. You're drenched in sweat. Honey.
160	455	Poor kid. I've been takin' care of him while his grandma's in the hospital.
126	97	Okay, I,uh... Yeah, I'll go to the library right away.
127	655	Okay, we're free.  - Oh, God. We're free.
151	461	Mike, I'm gonna be dead either way.
144	351	Do what we want or die.
127	490	That's what I'm asking you!  - I have a dance class!
124	203	You know what, Nora? Why don't you start the shower? I'll get the pants.
113	611	Now, in the last year, Lena Duchannes has been in three different schools...
127	407	I... last night she said she was having dinner with you.
155	1283	It still might work, but you will die with me.
141	211	If they find out, we'll all be dead. Trust me.
154	189	Anxious? Who's anxious? I-I should really go back to my house.
149	109	Half-dozen guys with A.K.S. not something you expect to see out here.
153	256	That means we'd have to backtrack. Why not go to the motel first?
124	172	What's to handle? He'll always be uncle kev.
123	400	None of this is my fault. - Yes, iis...
155	721	Thank god you're back. Sam isn't doing well.
125	646	Oh, yes. It's not exact lya French flavor.
150	570	I need you to do two things - deliver this son of a bitch to Pearce and destroy her laptop.
112	333	If I fall in, it ain't stopping.
141	333	I'll go to Drew. I'll tell him to call off the job.
112	82	Come and put your hands on him right now and just feel the flexing
144	615	Parking garages are designed with tight cornersto prevent traveling at high speeds, which is why if you're making an escape in a parking garage...
113	1099	It's the most powerful book of the Otherworld.
127	504	This is political suicide.  - Listen, I agree with her.
144	421	Good to hear your voice, brother.
118	722	I've been thinking about the whole Stanton thing.
116	75	I really want something new for the benefit, so I'm gonna go shopping.
147	389	The files are in a command post on the other side of the island.
122	583	No, but I want to. - That's Justin's chair, honey.
144	166	Now, we'd find him ourselves, but we're due back at H. Q.
145	525	We have to find your friends now.
131	191	Sorry. Guess I didn't realize how much I miss political scandal.
151	363	If she sees a road block, she'd kill Sam.
117	204	Uh, I have a couple of things in L.A.That I need to pin down.
119	19	Just debrief everybody, -- make sure there won't be any surprises later in the campaign. -- Well, what kind of surprises?
145	580	She scared him celibate. Yeah, she did.
156	747	Cody, look me in the eyes!
115	686	You know what, Tommy? I don't even know what to say to you.
160	374	Please. Please. Be good to me.
137	1222	You probably need a moderate-sized blast.
129	643	Well, why don't you ask 'em? - Because I don't talk to them.
113	1015	Hello, Mrs. Lincoln. Just a minute.  - Hi, dear.
147	279	Armand got me out of Ireland when nobody else could
117	331	Excuse me. I gotta take this call.
114	282	Oh! Look at you! You made friends!
131	300	Yeah, sure you did. Sure you did.
155	696	Fiona: you take care of Jesse.
145	208	Do you have a better idea that doesn't involve me?
162	1656	I just liked it the three of us.
136	635	Is all you  need to drain a bank accountand return a lot of money to some very surprised retirees but why stop there?
150	110	It's a try-out of sorts. There's a general feeling you're the best person for the job, but no one wants to be personally responsible if you screw up.
125	700	Oh, what do you think, Evan? Do you like it?
121	249	Oh, Kev... no, that's fine. That's fair.
125	254	At the moment, the fund has assets amounting to roughly 1% of its outstanding liabilities.
122	711	or gay brother or my gay brother, for that matter, well, Luther, you have got to be nuts
138	171	July '04 -- things geta little bloody down mexico way.
114	324	I don't need your help, dry spell.
123	112	She's really starting to look like a walker more and more every day, isn't she?
146	557	Very thoughtful of Wallace to box up his files for us.
155	514	No, I am not going to listen to you!
125	416	Would you like to waltzor would you like to fox trotor
162	1364	Well, what am I supposed to do? Just tell me!
129	60	It helps-it helps keep you fit while you're-while-while-Life is not a piece of cake.
144	211	A guy who almost got his head blown off this morning
155	318	Yeah, back up at the port.
119	711	Which is funny, because I want the one you guys had.
114	374	Mmm. What are you gonna do, brainwash him?
111	436	Who hired you to kill Mrs. King and Mr. Driggs?
126	362	I mean, th-- Well, we're always bitching that she butts into our lives.
158	522	Harry! Has－ Has anybody got a 20 on the drummer?
122	633	I'm not gonna lie to you, Justin. It's not gonna be easy.
155	311	While you convince our guest to tell you where Jesse is.
154	341	The ones filled with diethyl ether?
154	45	In the intelligence world, when an operation demands that you disappear, it's understood that you will disappear entirely.
132	309	Here, Kevin, give that to me. It's a support piece.
129	420	Nora, can I get you something to drink?
117	437	It's interesting to see you here, Kevin.
119	376	Uh, I don't think Kitty's really ready to have me there.
124	578	And you can't get a better architect than Roger.
132	55	Oh, I thought you guys talked.
124	141	And what's really cool is Justin gets to live with s mom.
137	512	I-I set her car this morning. It's done.
119	605	Um, Kevin has something that he wants to say.
111	449	I've been thinking about it, and, uh, I want more money.
137	663	Wow, you really unraveled that little mystery, didn't you?
163	274	We also know that predatory abductors prepare a nest prior to the abduction.
152	417	He's going to meet Quinn, a guy that no one could sniff out for years.
136	576	You know, for all your anti government speechifying, you do lady cop pretty well.
141	40	Laundry bluing is a synthetic dye that dry cleaners use by the thimble and covert operatives go through by the bottle.
144	410	Our jobs are on the line, and we're stuck on the sideline, Sam.
132	155	I had no idea. I'm a verb?
131	175	Because she's probably too busy reading this.
124	12	We have to take her to E. R.Okay?
160	451	Napoleon's my nephew. - Oh, that's nice.
148	224	And kill every single one of you.
152	103	The guy's on his last legs.
112	133	Not on the hull of the boat but on the rudder.
123	22	Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm great.
124	545	It's a womb... a womb within a womb.
121	99	Why? Is somebody screwing somebody? - No, no. Nothing like that.
162	1197	There must be some other sick soul you can inflict yourself on.
128	461	No one actually needs my help, not even you guys.
124	46	Oh, yeah. Well, I just thought that we should try and keep him as warm as pos
131	421	Hey, hey, those things are death traps.
150	148	All right, fine. We'll sneak in there, have a little chat, but no explosives, okay?
159	345	but you're never really gonna understand it...
118	163	He is out there on his own operating without any accountability, and american soldiers are dying because all he cares about is making money.
134	287	A similar trick can be used to temporarily disable a car.
122	144	And you are supposed to do "good evening des moines
113	800	that when I look into your eyes, all I can see are hers?
126	631	Who cares just go to the Walkers and see if they'll beat his price.
111	130	So now I'm going to wait three more days, and if he's still a problem, I'm going to take care of him.
164	202	Although life forms on AG-143 have certain comparable characteristics to creatures on Earth...
153	579	Card killed my brother, he tried to kill…
151	287	They -- they said I was drunk?
128	822	If you're upset about me and Luc, don't be. We had a really good chat last night.
145	260	We just need to find out what this guy knows.
147	474	My new friend and I are gonna take a boat to Grand Cayman, have a little chat with Commander Jackson.
131	259	Smoke inhalation, minor burns. - Feel like roasting some marshmallows?
131	580	You deserve to have someone take care of you for a while, Justin.
120	190	It isn't just one talk, honey.
132	585	I mean, here's a box with tax returns from 1988. - I know, I know,
124	334	I can take these. Just, uh, yeah, don't worry.
161	560	I'm just lucky I was able to defend myseIf.
113	933	Oh, my God!  - Genevieve!
150	95	What is it? -  Place up in tampa.
128	584	That wasn't a Lucky shot. That was an ace.
130	16	I need some input. Should I get the one in the cart?
159	199	Good morning, Dora. - Good morning.
120	756	Justin, we've barely seen each other lately, and last night was a big deal.
156	187	Look, Barry, you said that some of your clients got hit by these hacker guys, right?
152	551	Sometimes, though, you have to give up the real thing.
161	430	No! You, asshole! Get out of my house, now! Look at what you've done!
155	521	Dean is good enough to hack into the phone line and call out.
121	115	Gabriela, Luc... Uh, S'il vous plait? por favor?
152	637	It's a big place with a view of Miami Beach, close to the MacArthur Causeway.
116	561	No, Scotty. We're gonna do that tomorrow.
131	584	I - I know. Okay, okay.
116	342	You just-- you've gotta talk to her.
112	224	Definitely, our Kraken will need these feeding tentacles.
129	527	Statistics show - well, that's all jim dandy, peachy keen, Dr. Alex, but statistics can't hold your hand at night or or share a cup of coffee with you in the morning.
115	382	You got favorable response, for the most part.
151	313	Hi. I'm Chuck. Nice to meet you.
151	173	Is this where you tell me that deep down inside, I'm just a girl scout?
118	220	No, but I have my new hearing aids in.
112	521	I mean, this would be like equivalent to a shrimp platter
154	311	If you want to scare someone into thinking their vehicle is malfunctioning, nothing is more convincing than a small explosion.
118	403	Good. Okay. Let's go for it.
142	178	No, no, no, it's fine. Very sturdy wood and, uh, glass.
161	826	Man, you have no idea how long kids have been waiting to do that.
158	633	l'm just saying if you are, you might as well give up now.
154	458	I really don't want to kill you, but I'm beginning to think that's what's best for business.
146	30	You may recall that I’ve done this a couple of times.
151	420	And you'll be happy to know it doesn't involve guns.
113	395	Urn, you'll have to excuse me. Heh, I've not been sleeping too well.
123	438	Americans need a new kind of leadership...
126	368	Unless you don't understand the basic concept
150	203	What exactly are you thinking? -  get someone on the plane with him.
163	469	He framed don Haas and peter chambers for a reason.
117	489	So here we are... Kevin ... What are you talking about?
118	730	He never should've brought up the wig.
165	308	He just doesn't know you like I do.
128	398	It was my ball. - Why don't you play singles?
146	556	Hate to correct you, boss, capital punishment in the state of florida is lethal injection.
145	203	Absolutely not. It is too dangerous.
154	87	Look, we've got the cash. Vanek has the chips, okay?
138	176	I mean, if half this crap is true, Victor's a lot like you, only with, you know, rabies.
163	128	Chambers is a lawyer. He's always out of town on business.
153	210	You. You want to tell me where Westen's headed?
156	24	She turned the N. S.A. inside out.
126	475	Anyway, listen, I know that you're fond of him, but I found something out about him
131	668	It's kind of a retrospective of her life's work.
125	517	I mean, all of my savings, all of the money that William left me.
130	421	Do they have incriminating photos of you?
153	65	Michael, what happened? - Card's dead. They're coming for me.
154	600	What is Michael doing? - I have no idea.
114	359	Did you? - I don't know.
137	35	Cowan burned me, Cowan sent someone to kill me, now he dropped off grid.
113	116	Even though that is the middle of Christmas Break...
137	668	One guy did all that, and then he decided to come to miami and explain himself.
153	64	And there is a CIA caravan rolling in - two S.U.V.s and a command van.
113	203	Did I not say that to her at the end of sophomore year?
150	300	Second of all... You don't have a choice.
117	198	And if he doesn't, I'll take him out.
113	773	What have you done to him?  - Invited him to dinner with the folks, is all.
142	95	No, that could have been taken hours ago.
120	720	You stood me up, so he walked me back to my room, and I spent the entire night alone in the honeymoon suite.
132	625	And - and actually, I think it took its toll.
140	154	That's Eddie. Not a bad way to travel, huh?
153	488	Uh, maybe not. If you're right about the storm drain, we might be able to save Sam - right here, right now.
155	226	No, Sam, we got to get you to a hospital.
126	441	You're kidding. - I'm trying to not get depressed. I mean, we still have four.
152	86	Why didn't you tell me you were doing this? I could have backed you up.
150	383	We have three hours before the target arrives.
165	381	We'll have to go around the swamp.
118	670	I think Kitty and I should handle this ourselves.
137	192	My fee is $500 up front, expenses and an hourly as we go.
140	629	Man, get this fool out my face.
142	130	She's interrogating everybody in Mike's life.
136	261	No. Wiring crap into a car is not an art.
123	211	So he stopped you for a broken taillight? - I wasn't even driving wonkY.
137	369	Fi, give me that little tweezer up on the dash, will you?
118	326	They... They were lying about you.
128	82	He's an 8-year-old boy, mom. You've been there.
150	426	I knew I shouldn't have left him with his phone.
149	429	We'll move as soon as we hear from Sam.
150	379	It's good to have you back with the agency.
152	265	Me and Robbie are like a team.
151	372	I guess the question is, when's it getting here?
164	567	believes that when life beyond Earth is discovered...
164	231	what life forms might arise on other types of worlds like the theoretical planet AG-143.
148	299	Holcomb didn't say anything about splitting up.
136	334	Hey, how'd it go? Is Quentin your new best buddy?
124	695	It's just, I wasn't sure if I'd be any good at it, you know, putting somebody else's needs first all the time.
113	709	Oh, here's a good game. Name one species that'll miss them.
164	218	and whether or not you have liquid water.
165	350	Now, there was a young woman that I hoped to marry, but I had no prospects, nothing to offer.
165	142	Well, what do you call him?
115	522	Because if you don't face the truth, Tommy, you don't move forward, you don't grow.
141	178	I'm not going to hurt you, okay?
126	360	Well, I'm not gonna stop worrying about you.
116	559	No, that's all right. Wait here. I'll be right back.
113	1192	Is something wrong?  - No.
113	602	He can choose? Then why can't you?
153	262	Maybe he just didn't want to risk taking your call.
163	563	this will all be a memory someday...
153	272	But a bug with that range needs a steady power source, like the wiring from the lamp above a license plate.
131	568	His vitals normalized after we did a needle decompression in transit.
111	179	Emma felt that maintaining any connection to this baby would just be too hard for her.
155	760	In any kind of emergency situation, an operative's greatest enemy is panic.
165	469	These falls have been here since the dawn of time, and now bear your name until the end of it.
156	403	Now let's try this one more time.
150	524	It's just a matter of facing the consequences of immediate failure or the risks of trying to save the operation on the fly.
120	566	Do you remember when we first met and I asked you who your favorite president was?
155	363	You're coming at me with a good cop/bad cop play?
112	220	That's high-speed footage showing a long-finned
130	128	Oh, hey. Hi. - Perfect timing.
120	248	Sarah - You guys keep doing what you're doing.
164	411	As they move on, they reach a new area, they drop off...
117	117	Until what, the butcher's out of squab?
146	329	Okay. Is that the way it's going to be, huh? You going to extort me? You want it?
125	145	Mom, Kitty, I would like to introduce you to Luc laurent.
140	641	All right, you don't have to do this.
146	122	He was in the hole over 100 grand, Mike.
123	254	It shouldn't still be this bad.
155	677	Once you have the right concentration, you let the a. c. Unit pump it into every room.
129	503	Wait till you see this painting.
122	666	We drive it many times between campaign stops, but I just found out that there's gonna be a movement of thousands of angry reeves fans to collect lincoln pennies, stand at the side of the road and pelt robert with them as he drives by.
141	246	Big-deal sniper, awful busy during gulf 1, and the fact that Carla put a Dragunov in this guy's hands...
149	478	You think that could work here? Yeah. Is 10 minutes enough time?
120	457	And I don't care whetr they're asshats or how they made you feel, because this isn't about you.
141	410	Yeah, you just send the bill to that address there, and, you know, we'll pay for the visit.
116	379	Well... it looks a little like you're about to run off and join the circus.
147	313	I got what Cahill knew about the company that's paying for all this.
115	378	He comes over, I get to hear more embarrassing stories about your wild youth, and i'll cook.
113	1269	But I slept real good for the first time in a long time.
115	206	We were fighting the jutes from jutland.
155	372	Tell me what happens if I say no.
137	31	My plate's a little full, Sam.
157	481	He'll be nice and loopy and happy to seehis old friend Sergei.
146	356	Let me see those title papers.
129	42	Yes, you can. - Can't i?
158	260	You know, l－ l better get going. Uh, Mac wants me to reset the rat trap.
125	549	Do you remember the first time I brought you up here?
111	204	He was real big with, like, a patchy beard and crazy bug eyes.
148	514	In any kind of sabotage operation, the most important thing is keeping your enemy thinking you're on his side.
116	684	We should really go back. Robert's worried about you.
148	162	I'll be parked right down the road if you guys need anything.
161	365	Yeah! Run! Save yourself!  - Run!
115	750	You're not buying any of this, are you? -No.
123	239	What I lack in experience I make up for with hard work.
164	584	but people who work in that area...
133	128	Try and run down the ukrainian through a contact of fi's.
155	339	I'd take a bullet before I would turn on a friend.
112	268	No. Then I don't think you'll get seasick. You should be fine.
146	33	We could finally convert your ride into a spymobile.
160	120	[ Groans ] - the reflexes of a puma...
140	482	I got to go see what this Victor project's about.
137	1060	There's this club up on 22nd, dito's.
153	124	Oh, my God. I think that's - that's Michael Westen.
113	1170	What are you doing here?  - I don't know what...
161	225	Where do you think they got it from?
116	221	Well-- - most cancers are genetic.
123	102	And, Saul, I got you a double espresso.
144	687	The news just said that tropical storm Edgar could make landfall
145	128	You have to give yourself a plausible reason to be near your target.
155	534	And I'd love to give them to you.
127	36	And honestly, you know, I think it'd be good - to hang out with him by myself for a little while.  - Oh. Okay.
113	99	Now, just take any seat, Miss, uh, uh...?
128	371	I didn't think you had it.
132	652	Because we're gonna be your parents, and there's nothing you can say or do that'll change our mind.
150	503	Anson warned me you were good. I guess he was right.
116	402	I have the best stuff. I bought this incredible new stuff.
132	689	Yeah. I'll wait for you by the car.
161	859	Your brother, Bob Taylor.  - See you, Drillbit.
152	112	Now, that only happens if you find Quinn.
154	633	It's a five-drink minimum to calm the nerves. Do you want one?
124	105	Espinoza? - Yes. He's the chair of the appropriations committee.
120	184	No, mom, you don't-- you don't understand.
124	152	You told me he needed fluids.
120	570	No, a lot of people would've said Kennedy or or Reagan or would've tried to have been quirky and said Grover cleveland.
115	392	Guys, can we have the room for a minute, please?
164	309	It glides across tðÞe sand almost like a sidewinder as it moves.
147	124	Fi, I'm sorry I can't help you with, uh, the other thing.
115	84	Hello. So I invited Kitty, Robert and Isaac to a family dinner.
160	218	She came over to my house the other day.
137	1045	Don't need to touch it, don't need to see it.
148	582	It's not too late to surrender.
161	220	I mean...  - Come on.
122	275	Listen, Joe, I know that we're both in different places emotionally right now, but do you really want to rush into a divorce?
160	449	Is Trisha here? - Oh, I'm sorry, she's not.
152	274	Yeah. No offense there, but if I tell you, nothing stops you from cutting me out.
144	241	We'll have the real sheriff's department come and collect you just as soon as they're done cleaning up the storm mess.
111	148	I heard so much about you.
142	356	It's eight inches from the curb, you crazy son of a bitch! - Thank you.
117	42	Kevin, she thought she was doing the right thing.
139	243	I think I found a gap in the security at Carla's building.
135	365	Well, she'sa delicate flower, but lucky for us, I got a green thumb.
151	582	You said that the box had to arrive before the 9: 00 a. m. shift change.
142	247	Do you want his favorite Bible verses, freestyle rap?
153	135	Once you get a security team moving, your best chance to escape is to move with them.
146	142	We did. But I couldn't very well tell Nate's friend, "sorry your life's in danger, but it's not convenient for me right now.
161	638	Half because everyone is sick of your garbage and half because of what you said to Brooke!
156	303	There's nothing on the hacker boards.
160	528	You draw her a picture? - Heck, yes, I did!
113	151	You been to a lot of schools?  - Yeah.
158	98	lt was an accident. l'm sorry. Miss, l think it's, uh...
144	492	J-just go check the closets, drawers, you know, under the bed.
151	189	Just relax. The officer's just making us sweat a little.
160	529	[ Coins Jingling ] - Well, what are you going to wear to the dance?
131	255	Being a paramedic's what I want to do, and it took me a long time to figure that out, so if that means pulling doubles or working the night shift where I can't go bowling, that's what I'm gonna do.
154	281	What's happening? - We got to go. Mike's in trouble.
147	222	Some shady oil conglomerate hired them to wipe out a bunch of American outposts
130	371	What do you mean,"put down the bandage"?
162	1346	She had to go back to hospital.
118	455	Robert, they brought up the wig...
137	178	It's this job that I'm on.
153	617	If all you guys are going into hiding, you're gonna need a lifeline to the outside world.
163	464	Oh, I'm going to take advice from somebody on mental medication?
113	614	they had unnatural weather, they had...
124	186	You have to admit, she does have the phd in tending to us kids.
115	766	I-I always thought he had a lot of his father in him, but the good part.
116	454	Well, there wot be any drama tonight,'cause I got your back.
118	90	We want everyone's opinion on how everything tastes.
121	22	lies about global warming, lies about immigration, lies about health care.
131	646	No, I mean, I'm... I'm glad you were there to see me do my job... Which can only mean one thing.
150	299	First of all, we'll be protecting you.
163	370	Chambers represented Haas in a minor sex offense case 6 years ago, had the record expunged.
141	425	Hey, Lar, not a good time. What do you need?
123	36	Kevin, I said turn it off!
162	468	Sugar and spice and all things nasty.
155	63	At this point, she doesn't care who she has to hurt to get to you.
112	120	This looks like something out of a comic book.
146	598	Either way, it's going to hurt.
115	310	Okay. I have no idea where this is going.
145	464	One of their guys has disappeared. These Yakuza -- they won't take any chances.
137	535	Well, that's why he's watching, then -- the white van, 10: 00.
136	373	I got plane tickets for greg and bonnie and a couple of offshore bank accounts.
145	190	Well, like we're rival traffickers, looking for some girls.
140	292	You're in the music business, right?
140	316	No worries, brother yeah, I hear this a lot.
132	248	There is the most wonderful exhibit at the county museum.
147	373	All in good time, Mr. Vanderwall. But for now, we need to make sure that list he brought you is secure.
152	725	Michael, you can and you will.
117	668	When I leave, it's without luggage.
133	193	He can buy his life by betraying me.
132	129	Annie? - Just on a - a lunch break.
150	437	I can do it again. I will find a way.
147	507	How do you know he didn't destroy the uplink?!
126	718	I just wanted to apologize for the...
161	198	Coach says drugs are for losers.
122	307	Luther, I am happy  to talk about gay rights.
164	474	Europa is a moon of Jupiter.
131	284	Well, actually, it's a messenger bag.
149	400	You think I am a child?
155	1097	You know, I was slowing Mike down.
126	411	Oh, yeah. - Who's Henry? Your nemesis?
138	607	Okay, here's my "one time, expires immediately" offer.
114	173	I get too close to the door, and this rush, not a good one, and this roaring in my ears, and then the bottom just drops out.
134	217	Erik will never know. Just tell me about the business.
125	651	Paige, Cooper, this is Luc. - Hello.
119	776	When we were in high school, he used to drink a lot of beer.
160	51	I'm not gonna use hers, you sicko.
155	888	You got that from him, honey.
140	299	Let's get us some drinks. Sweet
125	299	No, I just--somebody said it was a great day for a swim, so here I am.
162	1452	I told your mother it was coming down, so by God, it's gonna come down. Get out the way.
154	668	You take care of yourself, Schmidt.
162	142	I suppose you'll be putting down lawn.
150	422	Uh, Reed's gonna be here in two hours.
153	193	If we're gonna do something, do it fast.
113	96	based on materials covered in chapters 12 through 24.
149	510	I'm stuck in the lab. - Aah!
155	822	Oh, it's good to hear your voice again.
148	195	Because the penalty for killing one hostage is pretty much the same as the penalty for killing all of them...
131	526	Yep, here, so cut his shirt open.
161	92	Excuse me! Mordor Castle coming through!
164	129	Infrared is the light that it's actually heat that you feel when you open up the oven.
117	76	Could we, um... pick up…where we left off…tonight? -I hope so.
142	172	What? - Hey, watch that window.
160	265	This is pretty much the worst video ever made.
155	770	Sam?! I can't wake him up, Fi.
118	382	I mean, I'm in perfect health.
124	366	Well, this is the antibiotic. I need the painkillers.
154	536	Look, listen to me. Schmidt is
126	466	Mom, there you are. - Sarah. Sarah, look.
131	97	Mr. And Mr. Walker, I regret to inform you that Vinny's mom has decided to reclaim her parental rights to her son.
162	1307	After trying for so long. All those tests and doctors the miscarriages.
146	318	Crap, Mike. He's heading home. He's heading right here, and he's close.
161	801	I lost it.  - Let me see it. Let me see it.
111	51	Suspect here, bursts through the door, shoots Mr. Driggs in the head, and then grabs the laptop a game console, whatever.
127	643	Look, Sarah, if we don't make it, and... and we're too late, and Luc and Ginny are married, it doesn't matter.
147	188	All right, well, unless we can do something clever to get past those guards, it's gonna get real ugly real fast.
118	704	Uh, he's fine. He's fine. They just, uh, changed his medication.
117	528	Oh. Oh, come on. Come on, Robert.
164	513	One example of a cunning underwater escape artist is the amabos.
128	488	I just want you to come and see it with me. It's perfect and...
126	764	That's not Marilyn weisman, is it, mom
126	154	You'd give me the chance to explain.
132	63	I'd love to take a walk.
155	698	At most, you only have a few minutes to inject the sedative's inverse to ensure that no one overdoses and goes into respiratory arrest.
149	280	I'm guessing that's where they're keeping her. One way to find out for sure.
128	264	No. I mean, the whole point is that Kevrah was great together.
161	270	That's all a teacher can afford.  - Tell me about it.
148	607	Here's Marsden, you son of a bitch.
118	227	Yeah, we could go tomorrow out of saul-idarity.
116	607	The fear of losing control is as dangerous as the disease itself.
150	546	I thought you were concerned about security, Mr. Porter.
155	1221	What -- what are you going to do when you get there?
163	628	self this to love or the hat
136	384	She just came by to say hi, see how things were going.
130	531	And then... then she stood there and waved and waved.
164	238	Now, because the star is an F-class star, okay...
146	380	I saw the photos. I can't get mixed up with this.
147	521	One of two things will happen now. Version one
134	143	No, no, no. I get it.
156	39	Pulling Sonya Lebedenko out of Cuba puts our operation on a whole new level.
118	133	Oh, he does those bike-a-thons and everything.
126	341	That's true. But you do it. You do it. You say,"hasta la vista," baby.
112	202	This is one seriously evil monster.
125	146	Nora, I'm so pleased to meet you.
145	153	My girlfriend is gonna kill me. This -- she bought me this suit.
132	602	But once it's all gone, it's gone.
127	91	As far as they know, it's just some random buyer who approached Holly.
134	84	See? Now you have to care.
122	634	You know, everyone here, they don't-- they don't know what I saw.
147	466	My guess -- after you execute us, his commandos are gonna shoot you in a botched attempt to save us.
131	520	He's pale and diaphoretic. Justin, you promised that woman. Are you sure?
117	119	Squab, and I'm stuffing it. Tell them all that.
117	549	I guess they don't know yet.
161	55	Look, I want nothing more than to spend the rest of the day sitting on this couch with you, but I got to get to class because my students need me. Okay?
136	232	The fact is, even the fanciest equipment usually needs help from a good, old-Fashioned crowbar.
129	557	And you have to be able to hear what's next in your life, what path you might want to travel down, with or without children.
111	427	And we're here to help save you the trouble of having to pretend you didn't do it.
115	390	Isaac, I know where you're headed with this.
114	352	Point is, a normal ghost that you actually wanna hang with is rare.
113	1421	to give their females something to play with instead of power.
122	220	you could see her. She'd be so glad to see you.
159	115	You don't think the White House is dismantling our civil liberties?
161	547	I just... I think it's weird, you know, that this is what I get for trying to make them feel like a part of the group.
161	714	It's over!  - That was easy.
111	196	They're pushing her to do something she doesn't want.
119	33	So no drugs, no cheating on exams, no hazing rituals?
156	787	I was going to get Tricia a ring.
138	598	I-I know I shouldn't have been eaves dropping last night.
130	267	You didn't even care about holly's news.
136	619	What are you gonna do, find some guy on the street, say, "can you wire money to aruba?" Nice try.
148	364	If I can get his team to start a manhunt...
164	278	With a thicker atmosphere and higher concentration of oxygen...
145	410	I do! I do mean it!
153	163	Unfortunately, the man who attacked him escaped.
127	737	Kevin and I have been through a lot...
135	499	Look, I just showed milovana bunch of properties.
152	447	She stays with Shane and Dylan.
122	122	Oh, and the young republican thing--speech--is tonight.
148	105	Client's name is Richard Gronbach --billionaire.
112	296	Can you see the bottom of the ocean?
136	23	You can't choose  your intelligence sources.
121	385	What did you say to them?!
161	86	I told you!  - He's gonna be here!
145	470	He'd fake an escape with Takeda... ...to get him to lead us back to the girls.
154	414	Sam! Sam, I think I have something. Hold on!
117	95	You just have faith that everything is going to be fine.
130	294	I-I do wish those x-rays of my molars would've remained confidential.
150	41	You can back me up with a sniper rifle from across the street.
131	367	I'm sure that you have a very complicated relationship with her, but with me, she was - perfectly professional, right?
126	746	And she went to law school with Kevin.
130	578	Un... I'm gonna leave you two guys... - No, no, Justin,
154	402	Like what? It's an industrial vent fan.
154	147	When do we leave? - A few hours.
160	52	See ya. - [ Dial Tone ]
159	54	Why don't you go down there and ask her? I'm sure she'd appreciate the intrusion.
161	26	Now is that Miss or Missus Zachey?
140	318	Well, Jimmy's a seven-figures deep-end-of-the-pool kind of guy.
130	719	Resolved... Paige is the best couple fixer in the world.
130	456	No. I'm saying my life with you is beautiful, and I cherish it.
137	694	It was a setup. The cops were there way too quick.
124	495	I should be the one taking care of him.
156	597	He just stepped out with the new chick.
126	456	Whatever. - Wow. I really can't win with you these days.
158	597	ls that the sound of them clapping...
165	219	Why don't you try and get to know him?
156	252	Hey, sweetie, sweetie, I asked for a fresh drink ten minutes ago.
123	5	She accused me of cheating on her so she could get a better divorce settlement, and she knows I won't fight it.
116	341	Yes, she is now. She's getting dolled up for this benefit tonight.
140	423	Now, I know this is a big move for you Eddie, but I need a decision now.
125	650	Hi! hi, grandma. - Hi, honey.
153	497	Sometimes there's a price to be paid, Fi, no matter what you do.
126	290	Where are you going? We need to talk about this. - Look, I can't think about this, all right? I'm late.
146	305	Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see what's happening.
148	267	What the hell's going on, Michael? Tell me you have a plan.
130	227	You know, politics is based in business theory.
142	559	If you go near her, if you touch her, if
154	222	All right, Schmidt, you better tell us what's going on.
151	288	Bill, I'm on your side. It's their word against ours.
124	54	Whatever works. - And if you want anything, just speak out because I, uh,
129	176	Just... A weird thing happened this morning with me and Luc.
131	268	The fact that my son is dating an attractive professor probably enhanced our reputation among applicants.
163	554	I grew up in east allegheny, just right up the road.
118	671	Oh, you told Kitty. That's good. - Yeah, I told her everything.
164	339	used present-day earth science to hypothesize...
114	358	He thinks I killed his father.
127	382	Kitty, meet us there.  - Yeah, yeah. No, no, I can. I can.
117	503	Uh... "William." mom, you really should change that.
130	191	I feel like I've crossed enemy lines just by standing in here with you.
160	46	Will you just come get me? - No.
117	483	I'll bet on you to fail.
113	996	And loving this boy puts you in terrible danger!
134	215	We need to give Erika good reason to skip town and miss the custody hearing.
160	471	I wish you wouldn't look at me like that, Napoleon.
112	300	BUT YOU'VE GOTTA REMEMBER THAT MY EYES ARE VERY SMALL COMPARED TO YOU KNOW
124	291	Good to see you. - Great.
111	231	If nothing turns up in here, I'm gonna lock you away forever.
162	777	I'm not going to school, not today.
163	173	There's no way an outsider stalker stalked these girls without being noticed.
152	136	He's a country- club member, he's got a society wife, and he loves to, you know, par- tay.
137	522	You can't exactly leave a note, so you have to leave behind just enough to get them where you want them to go.
132	461	Yes, until they hang up and then reality crashes in.
132	148	I actually know a doctor here that's been through the exact same thing. I mean ...
124	258	you living with mom and playing video games all day, because...
124	262	Yeah. I mean, I-I told her that you were, you know, taken, but, um,
148	456	Anyone who's used a cellphone near an alarm clock knows even minor interference disrupts radio signals.
145	310	Why don't we call your wife and tell her that you've found your soul mate?
140	675	No, wait, wait. wa-- Hey. hey, man. It's me, man.
141	422	Look what our friend was hiding in the wall.
122	454	Hey, if you cry, you'll make 'em right about gays in the military, bro.
118	219	Are you holding a glass to the wall?
161	107	Wow, that's cool.  - He is so cute!
126	322	Our brother Kevin, who did the baking soda volcano six years in a row?
145	472	But you'd have to sell the fact that you got away from Mike somehow.
152	163	We still don't know what kind of situation we're walking into.
154	420	Michael, we don't have long in here.
145	18	No. That was our tie-breaker, Fi.
154	535	If I have to send you to your grave to get what I want, then it's what I'm gonna do.
113	1096	See with your mind what you're looking for as if you've already found it.
114	258	It was just wrong. I apologize.
160	488	Do the chickens have large talons?
130	575	You... you have a lot of memories.
113	1285	It's not what I'd call a modern word.
144	27	And it turns out what they're really after are the secrets of a psycho who's obsessed with you.
147	220	The mercs are about to launch attacks in South America.
137	214	I know they're waiting for Michael Westen.
164	225	that we forget that it's the physical environment that really shapes life.
137	822	Called this number three times at the docks.
155	740	Look at me. No sleeping on the job.
122	96	Okay, the war moms from my online group have turned me on to "the heroes handbook" .
145	186	If they think you're cops, they'll behave one way.
147	22	In 1988. - A dead end.
117	73	Because after everything that this company has put us through, it would be very nice to find a silver lining.
145	329	I'm going in there. - Mike, don't.
147	394	We need 15 men in the jungle, 10 more at the north cove. You ever hear of a beach infiltration?
151	111	Oh, sorry, criminal. Not this time.
121	66	Getting beer. - Yeah. It can take a while.
130	334	You know, I worked so hard to get her to forget about William, and then when I finally believed that she loved me, that she wanted to be with me...
128	395	Here we go. All right, Kev.
122	325	We'll be in the car. - Yeah, this isn't-- this isn't...
122	484	Look, they have a whole chapter on dealing with your hometown media.
146	177	Get in line. She don't give anybody a nickel till I’m done with her.
132	386	Because I stole your walt, and you don't want to see me anymore.
161	20	Yeah, they'll just plug me in. I think I'm just gonna wait here until, you know, if they need me in French, then that's where I'll go.
112	414	So Steve O'Shea has gotten usinto an off-limits research lab.
128	572	Don't schmooze with the prince of darkness, okay?
156	330	And if someone tries to come in without an invitation?
135	267	Plus, I needa big, private space to work two captivesat the same time.
150	361	You're gonna call the tsa office, ask to check on the registration on the plane.
126	58	Adequate" is fine. This is our file.
132	354	I assume you've heard about the, uh, dorm window story.
159	137	Well, you may not have noticed, Son, but there is an energy crisis...
130	455	You're saying it happened because you were so ignored, you had to find solace somewhere else?
150	521	I hope your friend Jesse enjoys his flight to the badlands of liberia.
113	1171	power you have over Lena, but, uh...
119	517	And keeping with tradition, they've chosen to open with charades.
145	251	I had to upset you. I didn't know how else to do it.
113	45	Ugh. Is this what we're wearing our first day of school?
115	713	Um, honey, we should. We should go.
111	396	An out to here fro. You had to go there, didn't you?
164	1	In the beginning, there was darkness...
115	781	We went out in high school, and I ran into him when I was in phoenix.
154	74	When you're on the run and you're planning on doing some serious international travel, you need to be prepared to put together some top-notch travel documents.
155	1310	Just call them off!- ...3, 2
155	1184	It's classified, I'm afraid, which is why we'd appreciate it if you kept this quiet, if you don't mind.
130	272	You know, I've got a lot on my plate. - I think you're high.
116	340	Why, what's wrong? Is-- is everything okay?
112	262	I mean, maybe we can make it big or fierce in other ways, but let's leave the armor off.
117	525	I know that you and Kevin are gonna be okay.
150	188	Ryan, on your left! Check your left!
137	1217	It's like a fresh thing for us, you know?
124	351	I just need you to make sure Saul's not coming in here. It’s about him.
156	573	I'm still waiting for you to start laying those golden eggs.
161	797	Are you okay?  - My finger!
160	414	Yes, her. - What about her?
113	18	And our theater always gets the titles wrong.
130	511	And, Sarah, why wouldn't your father groom you for the business?
117	277	No, I sh... I should tell him. Seeing me is your best tactic.
137	1127	C-4 explosive with a remote detonator.
159	477	What was her name again? - Risa. If that's her real name.
147	210	And kill us? What do you think they'll do to you?
144	366	You know how willing Michael is to let the wrong voices
155	123	If you need to leave the country quietly, one of the best methods is getting hired onto the crew of a cargo ship.
158	163	Guys! Listen. Carley, turn the radio up.[Radio: Rock]
145	294	You are the kind of girl I have been looking for all my life.
156	338	Where do all their data lines go?
155	69	I bring you in, and Riley will have no reason to go after any of them.
115	410	A-at least the information that we have is true.
124	400	I'm not asking you to. - Yeah, great.
122	486	Because I have enough to deal with without you gloating.
136	141	So you're staying in town, then.
144	114	What? I knew we were just gonna get hit by feeder bands.
162	1031	Right, you start clearing all this up.
160	83	[ Coughs ] How was school?
164	350	And because of that, it's a cross between frozen ice patches green photosynthetic plants peeking through and some bodies of water.
146	101	Two weeks living in Miami, and you're already in trouble.
148	22	Either you tell us how to find the guy who killed Max, or...
163	540	Did she say where Kelly is?
132	434	I just hoped we could be again.
145	282	I'm just looking for someone more exciting, more my speed.
154	169	The chips are in the back flap.
119	331	Uh, we're just, um, you know
114	176	That stuff's just for the breathers.
148	470	I need you to make a scene right now.
145	118	Yes, but they said there's not enough information to find Norika and the other girls.
124	645	Look, julia's been asking how this is gonna go.
141	510	Drew, for your sake, I hope you're calling me from some place far.
116	217	Wait, if you're blaming yourself for getting sick
124	127	Good,'cause the vote's in two days, and I need to be briefed.
162	1041	Smash it up. Get it all out of your system.
146	561	Ah, sometimes you have to cause a lot of damage to avoid hurting people.
122	150	I-I know. Campaigning is tough for some people, but whenever something happens to your family, - you become completely irresponsible and - and...and what?
147	327	He asked you a question, soldier. - This guy's brain-dead.
121	185	the engagement I have this evening is with Karl.
163	265	I don't know yet, sir. - Well, what's been done about it?
155	932	They had high-res satellite images -- government images.
160	36	Is there anything wrong? - I don't feel very good.
155	688	To the door. To the door.
161	326	Well, you should be. Drillbit, I know you.
145	113	She said she had seen a sign with the words "Port of Miami".
158	227	Uh－ All right. That's good. Don't let me stop you.
112	162	And you can see they've got these amazing fins near the back that propel them forward and backward.
118	609	Please tell me about this friend of yours.
114	386	What if you drive him mad?
125	475	Well, that isn't exactly how it turned out.
153	302	He said "Riley." That must be the woman I saw at the hotel.
146	417	I promise you, I’m not a cop. There's nothing to find!
161	658	Jump left, jump left.  - Come on, Blue.
141	423	I guess Carla talks to her sniper the same way she talks to you.
131	22	Rookie, see ya in the rig, bro.
134	122	You want to shoot your stepdad.
156	507	That son of a bitch might know where Tricia is.
151	183	When the stakes are high enough, a simple speeding ticket can be a life-or-death matter for you or for the police officer who's just trying to do his job.
130	228	Exactly, theory. And when it comes to theory, you're all over it.
129	145	Look, if it was up to me, the job would be yours.
141	350	I-I thought we were never gonna meet.
113	1126	Go ahead! Start an earthquake, see where it gets you.
116	177	look, we just started drifting apart. That's all.
154	270	Schmidt tried to sell Vanek out to the FBI, and now Vanek's got us pinned down in a factory on Palm Drive.
125	629	Now, Nora... I saw you dancing the box step.
123	169	You just have to do whatever you can, anything you can, to make it better.
142	382	Mr. Davis, trust me, I wouldn't waste your time. Or mine.
116	598	The idea for open doors was simple
148	178	What's with the hardware? - Okay.
126	669	His name was ratmandoo, and you hated him.
122	56	And how you pledged to be true to him until his return...
151	396	Sure. You can have a cigarette. - Thanks.
140	752	My friend from the veterinary clinic said she'd never seen a species quite like this one.
122	704	I think what america's responding to is
132	24	Okay, I am off to wexley.
123	654	You...mom, you can settle this. We all played tiny tim, right?
124	455	Mom sent the cavalry. You must be, uh, in deep trouble.
119	118	Oh, they always do. That's why I make a reservation.
137	1240	You must have been, what, 12?
132	725	I was dating him right before William.
126	760	Nora, you're not gonna believe this
113	708	These parasites have had their own way long enough, don't you think?
136	599	Greg and bonnie. I took the cash.
153	482	They got to be waiting for backup.
123	482	Oh, so I guess I'mot the only one who's changed.
154	290	Hi. How are you? - I'm all right.
145	42	He also likes to cheat on his wife at conferences like this.
148	215	a gift certificate for a steak dinner...
123	133	What are you doin' home? - I, uh, took the afternoon off.
141	114	When a bad job comes along, you have two choices, and neither is very appealing.
131	113	So... As much as it breaks our hearts to say this, we have to let you go.
131	462	Well, uh, I've been having a lot of pb&js these days, and let me tell you, this is a lot better.
128	628	Oh, I... - Mom, this is my job, not yours.
137	874	Choosing a cover I. D.On the fly is always a challenge.
148	116	There's one more little --little thing.
161	105	Hey, aren't you the guy that kicked Filkins' butt freestyling?
131	340	What? You - You look nervous.
150	88	Time to find another way. - That is just wishful thinking!
142	369	Anything could be in that box.
121	341	Well, I'm a bit of a francophile and a cinephile, so I've seen all of the French New Wave.
125	601	Was it about aunt Kitty? - She has cancer. Grandma told us.
130	62	At least you haven't spoken to Scotty.
119	656	So please, all of you...all of you...
129	294	Um, nothing. I- I-I don't know.
141	62	Since I, uh, retired, I've been working freelance stuff.
125	190	So it's back, side, close. Forward, side, close.
146	469	All right, I’m going to call my guy over at dispatch, see if he knows anything.
164	364	Imagine what a redwood would look like in a world with lower gravity.
112	110	In fact, the first ever mention of a Kraken, from 18th-century Norway, sounds just like an oversized octopus:
137	128	Phone call? What kind of phone call?
115	640	Well, how long are you here for?
164	4	beyond the limits of our existence...
122	647	Well, then that makes everything else worth it.
145	152	you just scare off the prey.
154	93	Schmidt -- oh, he had a thing.
151	425	Oh, yeah, I saw the sign.
136	598	How? -I don't know. You tell me, Quentin.
164	147	that, once they move into the darker regions...
156	626	But if it isn't, well, then we're going to have a very big problem.
142	349	It is supposed to only be six inches from the curb!
164	78	that will be adapted to taking in infrared light...
163	145	Didn't she raise Polly on her own after her husband abandoned her, what, 12 years ago?
140	544	How do the seychelles sound to you?
146	19	It was really it was thoroughly cooked.
134	530	You don't score if you spike the ball before you're in the end zone.
159	228	If this kind of thing got out...
165	223	Now I find myself stranded with you.
111	19	I don't understand. She's... she's pregnant?
129	280	Um, one, uh, date shake. - Coming right up.
121	491	I mean, you've been in here slaving away, and we've been out there, you know, kicking up our heels.
147	511	Like good defense attorneys, spies know the facts don't always matter as much as how you sell them.
146	185	If the yogurt lady's daddy has a boat, I am exactly the guy you should be talking to.
124	694	No, no, no, it's not that.
162	743	I didn't want to move house, so I didn't help.
128	29	Uh, Cooper's become obsessed with the drilling we're doing up there.
159	1	So you were fucking the court stenographer.
147	73	I'll need you to get me this.
142	126	Barry, we're not asking you to storm the station.
150	279	Crazy lady, get it through your skull - I don't know anything!
130	46	Hi, mom. - Kevin? I thought I called Kitty.
116	469	Look at the way he's staring at her.
111	110	You're going to take the lead for our office. Me?
123	111	Are these the latest pictures of Lizzie?
145	114	Then someone took the phone away.
140	7	You look like you could use a partner.
163	59	Miles said it was an emergency. - Yeah.
153	518	Do you have C4 and phosphoflares on board? - Yes.
146	258	No, please, stop! I’m begging you!
125	127	I will meet him. That's it.
157	183	Yeah, yeah, but, uh, you know, I really need that list, Harvey, just to make sure I got all the bases covered.
127	716	Oh, no, no. That... that's not gonna happen, because I think you and I have to drink this bottle together.
131	324	I promise you, I will not get in your way.
137	311	It's a tiny little bit part.
131	106	Would you guys like to say your od-byes now?
137	963	Just need something nice and traceable
155	950	Michael, are you crazy? he wants to arrest you.
126	219	Nora, do you know what worried me the most?
124	378	I'm sorry. What have i do to offend you?
116	516	That's my son Justin and his fianc.
111	416	Show me your hands! -- Get down!
131	395	Well, it's-it's not a pupu platter, but... I wanted everything to be nice.
115	157	About us not arguing, not about Tommy being justified.
148	331	I just want to get this over with, give Michael what he wants, and be done with it.
146	456	Excuse me? I’m in charge! Now move!
137	1232	It hasn't been used, so it's untraceable.
142	153	If you're not going to tell mewhat we're doing here
139	457	Goes to check on the alley...
162	1276	I used to find his leavings by the bin.
149	122	Resnik made a purchase from a black-market chip manufacturer.
155	171	They -- they said they were CIA.
130	340	But, David, Rebecca's actually gone, and holly's still here.
122	391	Oh, god, I just-- I lost this  job- lena
123	9	You know, you ended things with me, Scotty.
119	342	Hello? -- Hey, Rebecca, it's Sarah.
142	105	My partner is a man who really enjoys his work.
137	1283	You've got such a bright future.
119	41	That part I don't remember so well, but, uh, I got pictures.
131	544	Oh, have you been published, Seth?
111	124	You know, I need to move the last Westfield shipment quickly, and I can't do anything until he's gone.
118	205	Sweetheart, your instincts don't suck. - Well, they do, a little.
127	96	They do, between courses. We haven't even started.
126	461	Okay, huddle up. We've been doing some reconnaissance.
160	224	I see you're drinking one-percent. Is that 'cause you think you're fat?
163	135	Hey, why don't you go on inside and make yourself comfortable.
137	1162	Oh, look, they survived Nate's exploding truck.
162	333	Right now, you lot, pay attention.
154	188	Schmidt, why are you so anxious to leave all of a sudden?
118	553	Um, mark down what you like in order of preference.
163	376	Does it strike anyone else as grossly inconsistent that an unsub this sophisticated and methodical would leave an obvious pile of his dna at the crime scene?
125	652	Luc's a good friend of mom's.
162	1036	Do you think if I'd given her more of a hand and stayed home from school she would have been all right?
112	424	But look what you've got here.
119	730	It's just when you get them all together
137	249	We want you to find a new way to import your heroin.
137	376	I'll reimburse you for the snacks.
163	96	And obviously, since the phone's turned off, I can't use it to locate the girl, but I have an open trap on the number in case it gets turned back on.
112	274	A couple hundred years ago, sailors would have lived in boats just like this
123	16	I got you. - I got you.
124	506	Yeah, and billed it to the ojai account.
124	499	Okay, you know what? I'm--I'm sorry I got in your hair.
164	600	running on brains a million times faster than human...
132	483	Maybe this isn't the right fit.
120	604	Here's room 1215. Checkout's 11: 30.
133	362	Look, I may not be rambo, okay, but if you're making a trap
145	588	I think he felt bad about giving me a talking-to.
128	262	Sarah, think about this. It would be fabulous.
158	465	[Danny] Hottie, mate. There's a hottie there. [Tom] Yeah.
122	78	Okay, mom wants to talk to you. - She wants to talk to you.
129	170	I want this picnic to be really romantic.
123	382	Nora? Nora, are you mad at me?
128	120	Okay, I'm meeting with Jim hix. You said something about education cuts.
119	206	Don't use our fears about you going to war to get us to embrace some stranger.
131	525	Okay, all right, I just need to reinflate his lung. - Here?
145	350	Get on out! Move! Get the hell out of here!
132	66	Outside. - Paige, we live in l.a.
137	308	I was just giving her a ride home, and, well, there she is, uh, in my car right there.
123	314	Of course I'm tired. - I'm not entirely sure I want to discuss this with you, robert.
115	870	Was not suggesting that Isaac and my.
120	175	She can explore in her bedroom, but she's not going out looking like Hannah- Montana- meets-a-call-girl.
153	391	I thought you wanted Mike alive.
164	303	This is why the pholis lives primarily near the water deposits...
140	556	Let's get a new bottle out here. - All right.
158	451	Job interview? Actually, it's a funny story.
115	103	Into him? What? That's like high school.
124	590	I will be making a cd of and putting in everybody's stocking come Christmas.
126	19	Sarah, why don't you just let her go to school?
137	318	What I need you to do is make friends with Kent. Okay?
113	725	She has got no choice in the matter, my darling.
124	293	Uh, does mom know you're wandering around like an escaped mental patient?
142	148	Besides the guards, there should be nobody in the building on a Sunday.
118	261	They better have cable. - No, no, no.
132	271	Well, it looks like our little paige is growing up.
155	216	And your friend there needs a doctor.
162	1212	Arthur and me, we're old friends, we are.
150	175	How many operations have you done?
141	215	She is going to be an old friend from out of town.
155	180	Damn it. they're on me, too.
125	497	Every other member of this family is very fond of Luc, including Kitty, because he's fun and full of life.
124	718	As long as I can be the crazy uncle who buys her tons of presents and gives her a place to crash when mom and dad fight...
156	277	Oh, boy. - Oh, boy? What is "oh, boy"?
155	508	We can't -- Fi, I think we should do this.
123	530	I have one mine for you, miss walker.
142	286	What'd you have, like a 4. 0?
152	391	The cops must have blocked off the whole area.
162	990	All right, get back down here. 20 lengths.
147	204	Mike, that would mean -- It means we're not getting off this island.
120	600	Is there a quiet place she can sit down for a bit?
162	667	It's all the spiders and insects you eat.
119	458	I can't believe Kitty is dating him.
111	99	Thank you for everything you taught me in the past six months.
158	101	l think we're clear. Thanks for that. Sorry.
124	160	Espinoza has got my back on the landsman bill, and he's bringing Johnson and Lyle and marshal.
145	493	Oh, my God! It's them! What do I do?!
131	265	I feel like I'm at the principal's office.
123	399	That's not fair. - Well, I'm trying.
155	652	It's fine. Just -- just leave it alone.
162	1586	I'd take it if I were you.
165	175	Now, when you get to the top, take this lever and move it back down.
154	615	Michael, Michael, I'll give you anything. I'll give you anything, okay?
119	661	That's my girls -- beautiful and smart.
162	1720	Where have you been? I was looking...
165	368	No. I made sure of it.
129	453	I can't let this big windbag beat me. - No.
161	446	Boo-hoo.  - I like the parts with the repelling and the crawling through the mud and the swinging on the monkey bars and the helping the wounded, but I don't like confrontation.
150	273	The key to breaching a building is getting inside quickly and dealing with the occupants before they have time to respond.
113	71	My dad is acting like old man Ravenwood. They're all bat-shit.
126	439	I talked to the clinic. - What? Really? And?
124	64	Uh, the doctor did say he wanted him to have as little stress as possible.
120	504	Where the hell is Arlo? - I know.
115	288	I had to make a choice. -just be patient.
133	197	Oh, well... You know, I was --I was in here, and I-I ran out when those men showed up.
156	429	When you need access to a restricted area and you know you're being watched closely, a direct approach is best.
125	229	Un, deux, trois. Okay, turn. - No, no, no.
111	3	I will be... incredibly sad to see you go.
119	28	And that file would be... -- encrypted.
156	717	Do you have any idea what Cody is up to?
162	1267	It's good she's crying. It means she's strong.
123	262	If he can't rehab properly because of the pain...
160	395	This is looking really good. - You can say that again.
120	87	My daughter-- Ojai's resident rock star.
113	1309	I'll let you know when to do it, sugar. You'll hear me loud and clear.
120	409	You said I could get whatever I wanted.
128	637	What, you know what? Time-out. What... What's the deal?
124	222	Kevin had a bad dream. - No, I didn’t.
156	520	That sleazebag from the car lot must have tipped him off.
137	450	It doesn't really matter who - - it does matter...to me...
137	915	He's trying to get us any information he can.
151	409	Uh, something tells me those airboats are not for sale.
120	413	It was a sequined mini dress.
162	42	Give us a hand downstairs. Some boxes need shifting.
164	217	That determines how much energy you have...
162	35	Bugger me, it is! A sm... Lou... Look at that! It's a smile!
153	618	You wanted to leave. I think that's the best thing to do.
118	164	Okay, look, I told you I'd go after this guy, and I've done my part.
119	254	Ken, ken -- a prominent surgeon, spectacular father.
122	513	And though commendable, it is completely unrealistic.
122	178	How am I supposed to sterilize her bottles now?
160	467	Geez, I think you ripped my mole off.
112	304	If you look sideways down there, you can't see anything.
142	288	3. 9 What does it matter?
162	662	Cod liver oil for your joints.
147	132	Thanks. Michael told me almost everything about you.
154	73	We'll all be safe soon, Ma.
113	103	Well, uh, now, that's an out-and-out lie.
112	271	Deep water? My absolute worst nightmare.
146	571	He had me terrified for weeks. - yeah, he was pretty convincing.
144	702	Matt Reese and his guys are in custody.
153	192	They haven't set it yet. - Are you out of your damn mind?
118	803	Holly. Rebecca, clear out. Clear. Rebecca.
125	155	Okay, then. Well, I'll just settle Luc in. My room's good, right, mom?
134	666	Mike, you've been quiet all day.
125	196	I don't want the Walkers to be the weak link.
135	460	We got the name of the mysteryman -- milovan dragas.
129	161	Well... - The grass is always greener, right?
126	478	My god, now you're insulting me. He has no power over me. I know exactly what I'm doing.
115	852	Whatever you decide to do, you don't have to do it for her, but you do owe her the very best life you can give her, however that works out.
132	327	I didn't lose my wallet. Olivia stole it.
136	182	He was cell mates with an ex-Partner of Quentin's.
142	457	Now, assuming you can read a map, just follow that red line right to my new beach house.
116	509	Who's she talking to? - I don't know.
161	542	Punish him, Dad.  - Yeah, don't let him get away with this.
114	375	Make him forget what you did to his dad?
124	79	Well, I don't want to be late for first grade, so, uh, I'll smell you later.
116	721	Scotty, here's something to help you guys"...
124	489	No. No, you were just trying to help.
137	1048	Seriously. This is not a favor.
113	531	Been feeling something every night since you brought that girl.
119	12	Kitty, do you want both of brothers to kill you?
112	427	Now, that's from a fully mature female, I'd say.
146	115	Nate, I don't I’m just not up for this right now.
112	169	Pound for pound, octopus arms are stronger than squid arms.
162	1492	It's going to be really nice in here.
148	432	Good job. You made America a little safer.
124	128	Okay, I'll brief you. Until he recovers, I will be Kevin.
145	281	You know, love, it's -- it's over.
130	57	No later, no excuses. And, Kevin...
146	467	Might be nice to bring a guy who's got an ear on the pulse of the cops.
120	484	Oh, my--that is hilarious being lectured about the joy of sex from someone who's clearly not engaging with that part of her life.
126	148	Simon, what are you doing here?
150	239	I am a little short on cash at the moment.
124	91	It plays music. It'll keep her quiet until she gets better.
129	662	I think we should adopt a child, because I read these files every day, and there are so many kids out there who need help.
131	429	I've got her. You got him, rookie? - I got him.
144	173	A black pickup isn't as rare as a modified Saiga-12k.
126	186	It's good practice for you two.
160	203	was gonna fly out here for the dance...
129	242	Uh, do you really want to follow Dr. Alex?
134	368	Put it down. Put it down.
129	483	I've made a horrible mistake. I do apologize. Um, for the
128	503	All right, let's stretch it out.
136	349	Go after a group of people directly, and they pull together, they get stronger.
129	251	Uh, don't they need to evaluate us individually?
155	1248	The cartel already wants me dead.
145	66	I'll meet you there in 15 minutes.
134	670	I should go. I need to follow upon that Strickler business.
156	383	So, Barry, look, I talked to a cop buddy.
156	345	Now if we're done here... - one more thing.
125	360	You know, I'm a little tired of being treated like the A. T. M. Machine.
140	518	So if what they want comes in a wooden crate that you're not going to be allowed to open you might have to turn your trunk into a makeshift x-ray machine.
112	245	Maybe armor is what's throwing you guys.
125	543	I know. And I'm sorry. But--but this is how I feel.
123	621	Uh, lia took the baby to go see her...her folks.
123	229	My little girl can do anything she sets her mind to.
155	841	I mean, obviously, I'm in no shape to be on the run, - so you're going to be much better off if you -- it's not going to happen, Sam.
111	444	Okay, well, then, this is going to be a little bit more difficult... for you.
129	197	Facing it... It's like a really cold lake.
125	320	Oh, whoa, whoa, wait. What's wrong?
161	847	I was glad to read in your last correspondence that Filkins was shipped off back to Hong Kong to be with his parents for breaking so many underage drinking laws.
122	346	I made a mess. I will fix it. - Good.
152	329	What... nope, nope. It's go time.
146	411	How's it going, officer? Or is it detective?
160	356	You-- You pay the bills for that?
134	605	N-no! Quinn, t-that's not --that's Pete! He's one of them!
154	428	For the record, I hate this idea.
128	63	Sarah, what happened to the time-out?
146	308	I’m not cutting you out. I’ll call you when I have your money.
125	132	Actually, I think that Robert and I are gonna go back to the ranch.
147	203	There's no way we're getting past them to our boat now.
128	72	Jamie barton, her ponytail and a stapler.
149	332	If you were injured, we'd have to. I'm sorry. What? What he's saying is, if you couldn't do the work yourself, you would need us to stay. Therefore, he would need us to stay, if he wants the job finished.
137	1167	Guess it's time to set my meeting with harrick.
132	97	But it's all just happening too fast.
126	20	Why don't we call the uncles?
111	15	How... how did you know? It's... it's Rex's.
150	262	Yeah, I’m gonna - I’m gonna have to give you a "no" on that one.
155	970	I thought this was a team, not a dictator ship.
142	416	I'll be right there. - Thank you.
161	470	Okay? And you can see the scar...  - No, get away.
149	136	Question - what sort of seating is your expert using?
126	559	I just thought... You know, you
148	627	Marsden said he wants us to surrender.
156	384	That dealership is known for its ties to some serious bad guys.
137	616	When you're communicating in code, sometimes you just have to hope that whoever you're talking to is smart enough to figure out what you're saying.
119	464	Mom, why don't you and Miranda Jones get down on the floor and wrestle?
163	152	Plus, your agent Jareau can be pretty convincing.
118	248	This is the address to the bank.
128	287	So what, just pick up the phone and make a couple of calls?
129	74	Well, I’m on a losing streak, but I’m gonna turn that around.
119	44	No. It was more of a brother/brother kind of thing.
113	356	Probation. Implies a source of authority. What is that source?
130	263	I'm... I'm just gonna go lie down for a little bit.
112	149	Yeah, I mean, what I like about that is that it went
131	383	And-and if either of you have a problem with that then- you know what?
136	113	Uh, i'll see what I can do. I’m gonna need to borrow this, okay?
123	625	We're making hot fudge sundaes down there.
130	73	Well, you better. - Thank you.
134	130	Did you have a plan to dispose of the body? You're not thinking.
127	83	Ojai is ours. That's what's important.
155	1262	You realize if you ignore them, they're going to fire on us?
115	385	Ll it hold? I don't know. At least we're not taking on water.
126	521	I-I don't think it's you. I mean, I think it's the age.
164	116	Now, one of the creatures that we'd find most interesting on this world is the peena-pod.
111	339	I'm sorry, Ma'am, but I'm not your grandson.
149	503	I'm just saying, things are going wrong, and I don't think it's all accidents. One of your men is
152	36	You haven't been getting much rest, either.
161	611	You waited all this time. Why now?  - Why not?
146	399	Mixed up with? No, no, no. I’d say it's a little more than just that.
123	543	And I just thought maybeou would wa that information on the eve of your...
164	191	that creatures supporting an extremely heavy structure...
156	653	How many more drinks do we need to get out here?
145	191	The problem is, Takeda thinks that me and Fi and Jesse are just soldiers.
117	136	There's obviously value there or York would never have made such a ridiculous offer.
147	531	Turns out Mr. Cahill gets really, really seasick.
112	118	You know, there's nothing like this in the natural world.
129	394	I’m really sorry, but I-I just I I’m not ready.
131	104	Oh, Kevin, please, stay in character.
115	656	It sounds like a great idea until you actually see it.
162	114	I can... help if you want.
155	246	...sea planes have instead of wheels.
114	243	Well, no. No, I never actually enrolled.
132	56	We did. I told him they gave me h.i.v. in the '80s.
154	506	You run out now, it's gonna be a blood bath. Don't do it.
127	476	Don't let me interrupt. I'm just grabbing snack.
128	324	Well, I was, but he wanted to go swimming, so I went to pick up his bathing suit and told him to wait by the pool.
141	142	You're changing the subject. - Yes, but I'm serious.
121	480	You... you're gonna go out there, and you tell him how you feel.
146	365	Yeah, we got him right where we want him. - what's next?
120	249	No! Sarah. - I'll be 30 minutes.
155	1222	I promised Sam I would make this right.
131	245	That nurse chick definitely thought you were the man.
115	95	Remember when you wanted to skateboard in the driveway with bobby lampert, and you were too nervous to be alone with him, so I pretended to clean out the garage?
142	133	Go here and tell fabian that I'm giving you the portable skimmer.
146	611	You have to move on. - I know. I will.
132	210	No, I - I mean it's ...
162	1112	We've got lots of proper food inside.
161	132	Don!  - Hello, fellow teacher.
112	269	Easy for him to say. He can swim.
164	479	How could you end up with liquid water so far away from the Sun?
113	1169	Wherever Lena is. Even if that's in Gatlin.
152	171	It's because of who we are.
136	578	Okay, so you bet they would be gone by 4: 00.
136	483	Men say things to a beautiful woman.
131	87	Great. Why do you always do this to us?
148	149	So, what's a corporate spy, anyway?
140	164	From this location, an item is being shipped to another location.
142	561	I swear to god, Westen, I will spend the rest of my life destroying you...
141	209	No, you can't go to the cops, either.
120	38	Alwa good to see you, Saul.
165	93	Nobody seems to know what causes it, but fruit seems to be the cure.
131	167	You're very sweet, but it was my decision to be discreet, so it's my fault.
122	256	and hold on  to your airsick bags, folks--  they're dating.
158	610	[Phillips] Come on. Come on. Let's go, baby.
125	660	So who will be the girl?
113	1337	wherein the powers of Light and Dark will merge...
127	98	What's up with her? She's just excited to see Luc. That's all.
140	561	You tell him to stay low, find a good hiding place.
141	252	So that's his landlady, not his mom.
149	54	How about 10 seconds? Almost done.
118	10	I'm worried... Do you think there's any chance that you could stop by over there and check on her today?
145	590	Well, you did drive 130 miles an hour down the Tamiami Trail.
129	570	Maybe we're not as different as you think we are.
127	67	Yesterday he made me go with him to Astroburger and split a Turkey burger and real burger so we could be "heart smart" together.
136	293	No, no, no, i'll walk away. -I want to talk about this.
150	534	Please. There is no time. If we don't do this, Jesse dies.
141	22	So, Mike, this is, what, the 10th Bill we've looked at?
155	358	Just give me something I can use.
113	717	They don't even value their pathetic little lives...
126	628	Why would he come out of the woodwork now
131	492	Well, you know, that and ramen noodles, right?
120	186	And it just--it-- it scares the crap out of me.
126	122	Are-- are-- are you aware of what you're asking from me?
112	127	So I'm in Brest, France, in the North Atlantic, which is the right place to be for the Kraken legend, since this is where it all started.
132	54	No. I found out that jonathan works there.
126	735	Yes, he had to there before he went down into the jungle.
114	267	So, just to be sure, I ran your file.
117	385	No, there's nothing to talk about.
150	296	Just come with us to the cops. We'll get you out from under.
113	927	Oh. I'm so sorry. I didn't realize I had that.
113	718	until seconds before it's taken from them.
124	73	And every architect knows when a city is looking to build their next louvre or Olympic stadium, - I found them... Hanging on your curtain rod. - Awesome.
147	488	It's less about the lie itself, no matter how useful it is.
115	673	God, that was a long time ago. I can't remember.
136	624	I'll give you my account numbers you send the money, and we'll meet up later.
155	942	They're going to start checking the motels sooner or later.
142	31	Well, until your calendar clears up, just know I'm gonna make my way through every friend, relative, and associate you have.
153	583	I didn't know who was coming through that door.
160	99	Besides, we both know I'm training to become a cage fighter.
140	663	Eddie, you know what? Have a watch.
161	627	Leave him alone!  - It's just not in you.
125	76	$10, 000 should cover the materials, but then there's also--hi...
144	31	Hey, Michael, this glass -- it's not half full.
121	318	Oh, my god. That thing must be 10 or 15 years old.
128	498	Justin, calm down. Calm down. - And the degree I'm gonna get in seven years.
145	96	What, is that all over now that you're back with the government?
114	332	Now, you forget about me. You forget we ever met.
145	557	Feds picked him and all his guys up.
111	180	We're moving to Portland, and, you could have as much or as little involvement as you would want.
150	42	No. I’m not just there to make sure you don't get shot.
147	346	You think we're intruders who just landed on this island with heavily armed troops...
161	303	Every day he's at the off-ramp. I give him some change.
122	153	I just wish that mercenary was less predictable and charmless.
128	387	I just need to learn how to chill. Right?
154	576	Look, I-I-I didn't want anyone to get hurt. This isn't personal!
125	134	What? - Okay, I'll go get Luc.
147	366	Oh, he's really pushing it. - He knows what he's doing.
118	72	It's not like I'm gonna be in a library the whole time.
124	529	I'm just trying to figure a few things out.

126	45	Unless he's been locked up in Gitmo,
161	687	Trust me.  - All right, fine.
136	378	Fi, just do me a favor.
117	66	No, we don't have half an hour. I'm not on euro time.
120	715	I just--I thought we just all agreed not to talk about it.
137	1287	You think it's okay to take Sam's car on the street?
144	664	James, where are your cleaning supplies?
120	124	From my vantage point, it was forced labor.
139	456	And the old guy gets up...
129	125	So wait. Tell me, is that—is that the famous jack?
129	474	Don't tell me that you're working on your tan, because we all know it's fake.
131	656	And I'm not some... 9- to-5 guy, but... I really want to make this relationship work, Annie.

132	233	Well, I hope you're not thinking about spending the rest of the day in here.
114	30	It is impossible to live forever perfectly.
132	86	We've got a car coming in an hour.
119	480	I just got off the phone with my brother Jason.
153	340	If we hit them at the entrance, we might be able to split Riley's team and grab Sam.
151	432	Uh, well, that's five bricks of C-4.
134	262	All of whichmade me curious to know where the hell did you get that car from!
113	436	Glad you're getting some sleep.  - Amma! How did I get here?
130	161	No. No, you can't stop me from helping my niece.
160	466	I'm out makin' some sweet moola with Uncle Rico.
125	560	And it breaks my heart to watch you try.
118	222	When was the last time you were tested?
120	406	Chloe dresses like that all the time.
161	767	I try to be reasonable, but I got to tell you, these boys hired me as their bodyguard and I will protect them!
119	313	Go pick up the dry-cleaning, make connection with half, illegitimate sister Becca.
155	432	I heard you put your brother in the field, not Tom Card.
156	79	You're a doctor who happens to be dining here, and I am your wife.
119	466	Don't be silly. Let's go watch them look at him.
148	98	Look, Mike, I appreciate you filling in for Sam on this job.
142	450	Nate! - You're good right there.
122	154	It so damages what little credibility you have.
140	186	So that should take care of the doors.
155	1018	This plan only works if Riley sees me here.
132	203	I was watching her like a hawk.
122	579	Uh, no. Probably still a little too near for me...
146	267	Damn it. Look what you did.
123	33	Will you just get a cd off my dresser, please?
119	677	I -- I did the balcony scene in, um, acting class.
152	191	Yeah, good to see you, too, Jimmy boy.
117	716	No. In fact, the logic is like a race track...
125	482	Did you cover for me? - No, Sarah.
120	792	You don't have to be in such a rush.
113	1456	You all set?  - Yeah.
153	149	Shut down every causeway out of Miami Beach.
131	74	Are you blushing or holding your breath? -  Take a guess.
128	661	I haven't exactly been paying attention to you lately.
140	179	And you can pinpoint their location in real time
115	739	Well, I'm a lot older and wiser now.
137	818	Uh, there's --there's no team around here.
153	120	Norm, what's taking so long? I need you down on the mezzanine level.
118	425	Are you guys okay? - We've been better.
163	291	Don Haas is the girls' soccer coach.
130	105	This is ridiculous. My... my baby's asleep, and I'm sitting here reading celebrity magazines?
141	354	No, you didn't. You were one stupid, careless son of a bitch.
131	49	The line is out the door and down the block.
129	648	And when they do, you look 'em straight in the face and say, "ignore me if you want, but I’m your mother, "and I’m never gonna leave your life, so we might as well get to know each other.
114	423	The point is, something's holding you back.
141	404	Michael, you're supposed to be honest with me.
137	916	It's the pose in the photo.
140	104	Oh, that vcr situation. -that's right.
162	251	I don't go to school. My mother educates me.
117	21	hey, I'm the guy who put you in the wheelchair. You want to hang out?

162	1781	This! This is what you call a song.
145	485	No. He caught me trying to get a phone.
127	712	I just wanted to tell you that I love you - and I'm gonna miss you.  - Really?
147	161	Can I at least get a ride back to my boat? - You can get out of my sight.
155	76	Trust me, Michael, life as my witness beats a 4x4 cell in some secret prison.
164	330	we've seen the extreme challenges that creatures on a world with little surface water...
155	597	This is Riley. - It's Dean Hunter.
123	614	He had 160 milligrams about a half an hour ago.
119	694	All right. Rebecca, it's yours. Take it.

124	687	I was the bad guy. He was ju being a kid. Come on.
128	129	Okay. And listen, you concentrate on getting those endorsements 'cause they could really turn this campaign around, right?
132	432	Whatever it is, I can't give it to you. Do you understand?
128	759	You would not believe the traffic out there. The 101 is... is bumper-to-bumper ridiculous.
124	552	And then he-- he waltzes in here, this Roger, this-- after 30-some-odd years
145	473	Fine, I'll -- I'll -- I'll tell Takeda that I injected him with drugs.

149	39	You know, for $2, 000, I want a uniform that fits.
123	630	Oh, god, I don't ever remember being this tired.

141	19	So if you're hunting for a covert operative, and all you've got to go on are the names of a few dozen suspects, you're out of luck unless you know where to look.
137	63	Could be a key-encrypted cypher, but really all you need is a base of knowledge that you share.
111	319	And then, he paused the game to go look, and he never came back.
122	357	Well, holly told you we're moving the offices to the vineyard, right?
164	455	The existence of extremophiles broadens our aspects...
114	378	When I do it, it's brainwashing.
141	605	How did you guys get here so fast?
130	156	Um... y-you know Paige is coming over...
126	754	Friends Or is she another investor
128	6	The painter said with all the sanding, there's gonna be too much dust. I didn't want to waste it.
132	414	And then you and I will decide on the appropriate punishment.
134	695	So what do you say we make thisa take-it-or-leave-it moment?
116	157	And besides, I had to leave and go to this meeting about the benefit tonight.
132	254	A hike? Hike, as in up a hill?
126	666	I'm just glad Alex's brain thing won instead of Henry's.
124	685	Oh, my god. Sammy the sprinkler.
150	336	Pearce and the team get burned.
164	190	And within this variety of life on Earth, Aguilar believes...
131	237	Later. I'm off to see the dean.
154	660	Um, feel -- feel free to use the house, uh, until you leave.
142	74	oh, oh, oh, Michael, no. It's not up to me.
115	68	You can't put Robert in front of a hostile audience and.
162	809	I want you to know that, no matter what happens... we'll always have each other.
119	84	You didn't tell your wife or your -- your brother or
127	459	Doesn't that mean anything to you?  - No.
153	137	If they do know your face, you have to get a little more creative.
112	320	You got my fear of drowning 'cause I can't swim.
126	82	Don't be-- don't be weird. - Sorry. Sorry.
125	607	I'm sorry. Just sometimes, you know I want to protect you from... from bad things.
137	160	Okay, you can tell me. Seriously, what's going on here?
130	656	I just wish there was something that I could do to prove to you how much I want to change, because... I want to keep growing with you.
159	240	The Karasz deal could be my ticket out.
132	265	I am loving is. I'm having such a good time.
124	338	But you played growing up? - No.
137	462	A minute after your deal went sour, Kent and Melissa were on the phone.
115	12	Well, you really want this, too, don't you?
145	436	That Mike doesn't mess around, does it?
134	114	Look, just --just let me go, man.
146	81	Let me tell you you're a tough guy to shop for.
126	244	Everyone has a price. That's mine.
118	615	But it was always in secret, and it was rarely with the same person, so it could never be anything real.
117	213	So I think you should know, I'm going to L.A.
163	136	We'll be in in a minute. - Okay.
122	123	Do I have time for lunch? - Uh, ten minutes, exactly.
118	725	We would take a major hit.
161	819	All right, let's go.  - Let's go.
130	207	Ah, look at that. Baby green jeans. - No.
133	329	I fought my way down to miami so I'd never have to swat bugs in another damn mangrove swamp, and now you just dragged me back.
164	383	But not everything on GP-C 925...
144	16	Spies have used book ciphers for centuries to send numeric correspondence that only can be read when paired with the proper text.
115	140	Well, you know, maybe you need a conscience.
153	483	Then it's all over. - Maybe not.
120	728	I didn't mean it. I shouldn't have said it. I was just mad.
132	436	Well, I guess that's not possible under the circumstances.
111	188	They were talking for Emma saying she wanted to put this baby up for adoption.
115	497	So I. I'm. I'm gonna get the door.
115	519	I'd hope that I'd be big enough to tell them the truth myself.
131	684	Well, if there's somebody that you made a connection with, you can fill out the child's name on this list.
125	142	Look, sweetie, you might feel good today, but if you do too much too soon, you could have a setback.
150	282	Have you met that Anson guy? I didn't have much of a choice.
122	45	Oh, my g-- what did she say about his leg? I couldn't hear.
112	93	It's time to get this bad boy back in the ocean.
147	457	Jackson? - That's crazy.  Is it?
128	51	You know, Sarah, he really is right. After about 5 or 6, there needs to be some consequences.
162	957	Michael, I don't want your mum carrying stuff, OK?
155	253	Never saw Weston or his team.
131	218	no. - What? -  Absolutely not.
134	682	I spent the last four days dealingwith reporting procedures for six differentU. S. Intelligence outfits, including oneI didn't know existed.
152	182	I mean, that thing's buried in Mike's belt buckle.
142	320	If Brennen's got a place in Miami, there's a good bet Nate's there.
117	632	And I wanted to kiss him back, but I was so scared of the way I was feeling.
116	176	Well, I know mom can be very stubborn sometimes
147	260	Yeah, that's cute. - You like that?
127	462	I mean, it's not mentioned in any of the other Ojai files, just this survey for $500.
165	208	Crusoe, he is not the same man you told me about.
118	543	Yeah, you know what? He... He's fine. He's fine.
159	275	This is crazy. Someone had to hear that.
156	107	Okay. - Ron. Wake up. Ron?
130	335	I-I got her an engagement ring.
127	665	It's okay. They're with me.  - And who are you?
162	194	By the way, there's an insect in your hair.
140	6	NO LITTERING PLEASE HELP KEEP OUR CHESS PARK CLEAN
152	102	He's got a witness at North Miami General Hospital.
145	442	Well, that commission just bought me my winter home in Aspen.
137	406	I think he's terrified of his supplier.
128	790	I've been thinking about how much Jake and the other guys mean to me.
163	25	Go on, I'll be right in.
120	464	Would you give us a minute? - Of course. Keep the brochure.
154	250	Fi, this goes deeper into the factory.
125	322	Besides, Luc is cooking a big French dinner for everyone.
164	293	And the odd thing about this creature...
147	273	No big deal? You're asking me to plant a bomb, Sam!
124	322	It was, uh, it was amazing. I'm gonna--I...
131	145	This is my high school yearbo photo.
128	409	Sarah, I think it was out. That's all I'm saying. - You know what?
130	350	Really. Yeah, it really is a word.
123	370	I know, but you know what? I had surgery. I'm gonna feel pain.
154	57	This can't be how this works. I mean, surely there must be arrangements.
137	41	Wow, it looks like your buddy Cowan finally made contact.
124	377	Well, thank you so much, but I'm really not a charity case.
155	1050	Got another CIA vehicle, about half a dozen guys, and local police, too.
151	440	She just wants an airboat and for you guys to clear out until after we're gone.
163	64	the varsity team-- she got a scholarship to penn state.
140	29	Then I suppose we turn the screws until you get interested.
154	640	Vanek had to see real fear in your eyes, otherwise he wouldn't move his men over towards the transformer.
119	735	I think that they have some kind of gene mutation that -- that won't let outsiders in.
128	463	I just assumed that you... - No, no, no.
132	579	She's not hiding in one of these boxes.
154	415	Okay, make it quick 'cause Vanek's guys are coming in.
153	266	We got about two minutes until they're right on top of us.
118	445	I'm sure it's just some wing nut with a computer.
152	576	Jimmy said something about you expecting a reward for your information.
127	400	No. She's not answering her cell phone, so everything I hear is pretty much secondhand from Holly.
145	265	But cracking him's gonna take more than a few hours, so I need your help... with my other thing.
120	127	Now we gotta get Wade Newman.
112	227	This is probably the last thing that any prey would see Sucked into its underside.
136	650	Call it $300, and you promise not to enter any more contests?
152	247	Well, they're setting up road blocks all around the area.
152	457	Maybe there's something in here we can use as a weapon.
144	395	You know, and I'm a big fan of corinthian leather, but we go down the wrong street in this car, we're gonna be needing oars.
126	546	See, the eyes took a picture of it,
156	739	We're going to settle this right now.
114	135	So, what's it like working in a hospital?
162	190	Didn't anyone ever tell you it's rude to stare?
155	845	You were supposed to be here 20 minutes ago.
134	499	The car you sold to mr. Carson could only have come from two factories in italy.
148	530	he goes to all this trouble to stop us, but he leaves you alive.
119	141	No. I -- it's Easter, okay?
165	383	I should never have brought us this way.
130	586	Because I just put some apology chardonnay in the fridge for you.
132	675	Well, I've done the whe idiot check, and there is not a single item left in this house.
154	238	Fi, we can beat Schmidt up later about this.
136	177	How do you like the name Peter jordan?
119	275	The whole family...that was so sad.
111	451	Stop. I'll meet you. At the park on Harvard.
117	168	No one wants to sit around waiting for Kevin to show up, watching you get depressed. Look, Scotty, I'm no fool.
164	192	become the perfect model for understanding evolution on AG-143.
130	612	Okay. - But I've been thinking about it, and you would be an amazing person to do this venture with, so if you really want...To go into business with me...
162	1366	I'm trying to help you. I just wanna do something right!
124	103	Oh, for god sakes. - I'm sorry.
144	284	Oh, is that why you knocked before you came in?
160	360	I'll bet she does. I'd be throwin' you out the window.
155	1325	You're locked away until the process is over.
148	588	Who says t-they'll kill us? They weren't going to before.
153	148	I want make and model of the car, where it's headed, and who's driving.
146	35	You know what happens to smoke at 60 miles an hour? It dissipates.
152	558	Looks like someone's getting put down today.
119	742	Just remember, if you ever feel intimidated, not one of them has a musical bone in their body.
137	513	It's not done until it's done.
140	649	Oh, man. This is your fault, Ricky.
125	428	Come on, Kevin. Please. Yes, yes, yes.
113	701	Lena's birthday is gonna fall on the most powerful solstice in 5000 years.
119	501	No, I'm not. I'm beyond that, okay?
145	85	Are you talking life and death?
120	307	You know, it's-- it's a good cause, honey.
122	673	All right, all right, I'll do it.
148	137	A quick trip to your lab, we take some stuff off a computer, you never see me again.
122	622	No, I-I wish I were, you know?
125	461	You know what? I'm making a decision now.
122	372	When we were little, saul used to take us to the most expensive restaurants.
123	150	Oh, yeah, you're fine. You're terrific. We should all be so lucky.
150	268	Fine. I'll make the necessary arrangements.
119	174	Oh, I promise, he's completely your type.
149	231	Pearce thinks they tracked her down.
128	454	Were Venus and Serena drinking?'cause you seem very relaxed all of a sudden.
144	161	Well, then, stop bleeding all over my mom's table and get to it.
145	130	I come off the plane. I just fly in M. I.A. and a custom officer pulls out Cuban cigars -- a full box.
124	275	Why are you here? I-I thought that meeting got canceled.
153	624	This is a fight I can't win.
156	227	Central Bank of Belize, First National Bank of St. Lucia, 5 mil in a weekend.
123	599	I'll keep track of your dosage.
116	136	Okay, we create a second wine label, we call it Diversification.
124	115	Robert, please. Can you please move away from the patient?
158	44	More your type? l totally agree. Wha－
145	385	I'm sorry. - "Sorry" doesn't cut it!
152	512	Because my father has friends in every police department in the country, not to mention every politician he's personally bankrolled.
114	192	Oh, and then ditching last minute.
158	81	This is all probably a－a dream that l'm having...
111	410	The 1800 block of Figueroa. 30 units.
144	564	Weather "vane" seems easy enough, "gray hair" means a gray roof, and "presidential" means he should be looking for a white house.
149	578	When will it be enough? When I say it is.
146	489	Give me those pliers. Going to find out what that son of a bitch knows.
115	652	If you have a beta. -What?
148	542	Stop it! Admit it you're working with Marsden.
136	530	A hit man is like a plumber, a dentist, or a mechanic
114	411	Yeah, a portal that takes you beyond, whatever.
136	172	They run operations, they follow security procedures , they recruit support staff  and issue orders.
134	52	Well, I might be able to help out with that.
141	381	And when I come back, I want good news or you're my next dead-ee.
137	140	You shaved the ferret off your face.
113	1066	You are not going Dark and you are not losing me.
114	80	Leave the hairy stuff to us cops.
113	987	Sarafine recognizes it too. She knows that without the curse...
160	119	with the strength of a grizzly...
121	68	I'll come with you. - Talk to you later.
158	225	[Chattering] This is－This is big. How's my follow-up coming?
129	167	You could go crazy and do a heart-shaped strawberry torte kind of thing.
141	198	He's my husband's son from his first marriage.
113	400	This window shattering is just the beginning.
163	559	You know, your mom carried a picture of you all the way up to the FBI academy in quantico, virginia so that me and these agents here could help find you.
113	1217	There's only one way to break the curse.
137	87	My friend Melissa -- we work together.
112	436	Yeah, thought you might like that.
131	230	He... He never had a family before.
112	157	What I can show you is some footage of a Humboldt squid.
120	268	Trick is, you can't baby 'em, otherwise they get soft, like democrats.
155	323	The first guy who tells me where my friend Jesse is being held is released as a sign of good faith.
148	597	We can use the crates as cover to get closer.
113	378	So I can stay with Dad.
118	711	And that... That's what I want for us, Rebecca.
161	554	The more I think about it, that guy, he could've really hurt me.
124	249	You know, the book, e reason that I don't work here anymore?
129	26	If you've been dreaming about installing a garage…mom.
117	91	It's Kevin's birthday, and he's not talking to her.
161	647	You're nothing but a pathetic wimp, and everyone's gonna know by the end of tonight, brother!
151	259	I'm fine. I need to get a message to Michael. It's urgent.
151	541	It better be the right key. - Aah yeah.
142	399	Fine. I do this, Nate is released unhurt, and I never see you again.
138	411	I needed help selling acover I. D.-- Nothing personal.
116	539	Well-- - I'm-- I'm sorry. Rebecca, have you met my mother, who wouldn't let me within 100 yards of a motorcycle?
129	151	I've read all her books, I - I follow her on twitter.
130	387	That's how you start a debate.
142	489	You think or you know? - Somewhere in between. Does Ri have any C-4?
126	121	If he's charged with corporate sabotage-- What do you want from him?
126	467	No, listen-- th-this young-- this young woman has found out that it's better to water plants with water than with soda.
126	334	How is it having robert home?
146	224	Once we get our new boat, I’ll take yogurt lady and her daddy on a trip to the everglades.
121	73	I couldn't find a number of the notary that we used for the Maris Media proffer, so I was scrolling down the calls from last week, and I came across "Gabriela Laurent.
160	235	Napoleon, give me some of your Tots.
126	174	Like a radio. - Yeah, radio's a good start.
154	307	And if it's not, well, I think you're gonna be very grateful to both of us for coming all the way down here, believe me.
152	499	No one needs to see these, including your wife.
122	410	Yeah, I know, but it's because I kissed him back.
118	726	And we might even lose, but...
113	1395	The moon appears, and it will claim you as you are destined to be claimed.
128	613	Cooper. Cooper. - Cooper, what are you doing?
149	583	Now is not the time to panic. Do you understand? I understand.
122	582	Hey, Coop. Come on. Grandma's right, out of there.
131	150	Yeah, but I mean, come on, you used to spin things for a living, right?
131	550	I'm not making excuses for you. - You've been answering questions for me all night long.
145	481	Michael, you know this is the only way.
115	612	Right up until Julia came back.
145	482	I'll call Fi and Jesse -- let them know what's going on.
160	381	At the moment, nothing comes to mind.
119	670	Romeo is Montague. Juliet is Capulet.
118	143	What about you, Saul? - What, me, tested?
132	212	We found her hiding a teenage boy in the guest bedroom, sarah.
154	337	You come down here, and then you hide behind these barrels, all right?
129	83	You know, we could probably afford to try again if that's something…
161	27	Miss.  - Miss. It had to be. Enchante.
161	864	Oh, my God. - There he is.
156	663	You got something to say to me, you can talk to my lawyer.
137	304	Thanks, but I think he wants a little alone time with me.
140	688	You ever need anything -- I mean, anything, it's just say hello to your brother for me.
160	31	You think you're funny? Just watch your step.
129	401	Well, where are you gonna go?
124	587	Can we just go home? - Sure.
148	287	Maybe you're not worried about jail, but I am certainly not going back!
153	330	There are enough boats and buildings there to keep them searching for hours.
124	44	But look at this. My god, Scotty.
146	113	She thinks he's going to kill her. - tell her to call the cops.
162	384	It's not OK. Don't tell me that!
154	629	You had me going there, brother. - Nice shot, Michael.
111	479	Maybe we should call it off; he's falling apart.
159	388	A lot of time and energy invested with a potential for no payday.
125	347	Is everything okay? - Yeah, I'm just a little tired.
158	204	this backpack has seen me through just about everything.
117	344	Uh, I don't know. I don't know. He won't tell me yet.
146	119	The day after paul's funeral, this guy, Carter, showed up.
130	513	You know what? Karl is right.
137	370	That's okay. I got it. Thanks.
113	961	She had the temerity to fall in love with a mortal...
129	548	All you need from her is just to listen, that's all, a place where you can talk out loud so you can hear what you really think, what you think, not... Her.
141	649	You knew that kidwas dead anyway.
141	24	You made me buy you a beer after Bill number 8. - Yeah?
118	249	Now this is in both of our names, and you and I are the only ones who know about it.
129	422	Oh, Nora, please. Call me alexandra.
151	181	You sure? - I said,"step on it.
161	361	Okay, here's the deal. Let me make it real simple.
124	287	Hi, I'm Scotty. - Roger grant. Nice to meet you.
155	259	It's time to show him how serious we are.
148	127	Dixon, I just need a small favor, okay?
151	144	Okay, now, there's a guy who's gonna find you.
136	429	Two stupid kids I’d have to share my score with?
137	961	Fi and I are gonna probe these guys, see how serious they are.
161	612	My life sucks so badly, even if she says no, it's not like I'll have very far to fall.
159	129	and God forbid if you're anti-war, pro-choice, or gay or not one of their fanatical legions of evangelical hand puppets.
118	748	I'll tell them we'll think about it. Mom, we're gonna think about it.
145	77	My, my, my. Private security looks like the life. Nice suit.
144	281	Turks love me. Ladies love me.
136	638	Most fun i’ve had in miami.
147	264	The mix of nitrate and magnesium in a marine flare burns at over 3, 000 degrees.
145	132	The Same thing happened to me trying to bring some peanuts back from Khartoum.
140	506	And that's all you need to know, sport.
118	36	Why are you so nervous? - I just... I just...
146	601	I didn't actually say that. You said that. I just didn't correct you.
145	76	Yeah, well, that man doesn't focus unless an international conspiracy is threatening to ruin his life.
160	50	Just borrow some from the school nurse. I know she has, like, five sticks in her drawer.
156	314	Our employer, moron that he was, he didn't secure his I. S.D. N.
154	236	Vanek is going after your business.
130	720	True. Hurry up. You're gonna be late. - Yeah.
129	7	If you wanted to take the morning - oh, no, no, no, no.
129	450	This is a fight you could win, and I could sure use a win right now.
112	291	With all those tasty meals out there, why would a Kraken go after a ship, which is basically a bowl of wood?
151	191	Okay. Just let me deal with this.
129	49	Okay. I gues I’m having a little trouble since Rebecca left.
140	248	I just want to make my pitch.
119	234	This is a Walker, isn't it?
113	906	Let me get your change.  - Thanks.
132	709	You want to go play in the playroom with sophie and jack?
146	481	No, stay out of sight. I’ll get them running. You sweep them up.
136	92	When madeline said you could help me, I was so relieved.
120	458	Right? So from now on, - Hey, guys. - Hey.
154	667	But I get the feeling I-if I hang out with you much longer, my luck's gonna run out.
146	91	That you're obsessing over the people who burned you even though they're either dead or in jail? I might have mentioned it.
130	413	I... that was you on my voice mail canceling our date, right?
131	102	No, I'm sorry. This is wrong.
115	491	Robert, get off the phone. I don't care who you're talking to.
140	644	You know, I almost wish they did know.
160	353	Or else work afterwards. How long's the chat room?
146	587	I didn't tell you when I decided.
129	162	I guess so. - Oh, come here, you.
119	606	Me? -- Well, yeah, okay, I.
118	73	I mean, I'm down there helping out people, you know?
140	499	I'll go in and cut the bolt on the door and remove the object while you babysit the car and play lookout.
153	541	This won't be as easy as we thought.
126	580	That's not the point. I was trying to prove something.
149	584	Did you get the package I sent you? Yeah, I got the package.
161	553	Yeah, this boy's not dangerous, not compared to a dirty, homeless ex-soldier.
112	322	And then you got my fear of heights.
145	476	Did he -- what -- do this -- something like that?
148	313	Jesus. W-we got to call the cops, man.
150	219	No one in this conference... ...is hiring.
141	454	He told me that he was gonna get a dump truck, and he was gonna hit her when she was coming home.
155	1120	3: 00 p. m. - Whatever Sam said to her worked.
161	588	Hey, wasn't that fun?  - Hell, yeah.
156	804	I've been working for you people long enough.
142	231	Sig 226. That's an impressive pieceof hardware.
146	535	We can do this. - no.
144	37	You know, I thought the weird feeling in the air was just the calm
134	228	Uh, Mike, I'm gonna go put together a name and a game for you.
131	631	So we're gonna take a short break.
144	743	This is Agent Harris. I'm Agent Lane.
148	311	Yeah, your thieves aren't hacking airport computers, Jesse.
152	408	And the more focused the flames, the faster everything burns.
122	467	Yeah, well, Nora's been a little wiggy recently.
163	327	What the hell is wrong with Pete, huh?
144	723	And in return, he promised Jesse his life back, the life he had before you got him burned.
154	28	Can you do that? - Yes. Yes.
137	382	If my husband sees you here - - I understand. I'm sorry.
154	360	Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.
147	444	I don't know who you people are but I'm beginning to think you've been lying this whole time.
118	577	Look... I got dizzy, all right?
149	209	But we can't leave Jesse in there forever while we're hunting this Resnik girl down.
149	18	The tougher the security, the more valuable the information it's protecting.
141	580	Where did the man in black come from?
115	649	Please tell me you brought a copy.
126	276	There's nothing to understand. I don't even understand. I studied for these exams.
123	173	I got a plane to catch. - Honey, it's your plane.
124	522	You had plenty of choices. You just made thwrong ones.
136	409	I told them that you were the perfect son, that you always wrote me, and you called me all the time and that the most important thing to you was family.
145	266	With your CIA job? - Playboy needs a sitter.
111	594	So you're not gonna be leaving anytimee soon?
150	541	Make sure the security can't leave.
155	487	Fi! Fi, I don't -- no more games, Michael.
141	376	There's one way you live. You call off this hit.
131	448	Don't tell me you don't know who barbra streisand is.
130	698	Mom, um, I wanted you to hear this from me.
139	30	Tailing a trained operative requires a number of time-consuming preparations, everything from acquiring a vehicle they can't recognize or trace to familiarizing yourself with all the local traffic patterns.
111	306	No, you, here, I just type here?
116	495	Yeah. Well, you know, we'll just have a good time. - Yeah.
136	512	Quentin, you need to learn to reach out.
128	501	The last thing he would want you to do is stop living your life, and if you're trying to shame me into not wanting a comfortable future with you, then... then you're right, I don't understand.
151	81	Yeah, about that. I'm keeping Sam for a while.
129	446	You said you wanted it. - I do, I do. Oh, I do.
120	653	You got me out of the poorhouse, okay?
132	206	That's why I had to rush straight here from the airport?
136	132	Five days, you bring a sleeping bag, and you're out by the weekend?
116	463	He'll talk to anyone, even strangers.
130	256	Wow. Oh, tell him about the, uh, the paperweight.
130	107	You're a single mom. Evan's only 3 years old.
142	355	All right, all right, all right! It's eight inches, all right? - What?
155	1053	No, not yet, but it won't be long.
126	17	You know, I have this afternoon free. Maybe we could finish yours together.
131	208	She is allowed to date whomever she wants.
159	343	You're never going to understand the power of wealth and the subtle guarantees in life that come with it.
115	375	Were you guys grifters? -I wish.
156	83	Someone else is taking care of that.
131	194	This is your letter of recommendation.
127	130	Justin, it's also a very big step.  - Yeah, but you know you love him.
137	196	Sam just hired me for a job.
123	600	I'll be with you. It'll be okay, Justin. I swear.
148	238	You know how I ended up in the joint?
132	273	by the way, listen to them when they say get to the airport early.
116	207	Nobody knows what the best treatment is.
120	744	I have a daughter who is moving forward to the next stage of her life.
153	235	I need you to meet me at 9: 00 tomorrow morning at dad's old fishing spot - the one we went to when I was 12.
162	1308	I thought she was our piece of luck, our miracle.
145	491	Hope your mom knows what she's doing, Mikey.
129	553	You tried, and it didn't work out, and that loss, or disappointment, as you put it, is just as real as Catherine's.
131	20	Oh, no, we've had that today, too.
148	242	Feel free to check all the stalls next time you go take a leak.
136	482	Whether you're in moscow, tehran, or miami, club girls are a good source of information.
140	600	Hey! you call this table scraps?
130	221	Yeah. No, Sarah, I meant it when I said it.
125	147	And thank you for inviting me to this beautiful home.
148	399	Caleb, we might have a problem.
164	85	from the plant life to the larger, more complex creatures.
154	561	There's nothing but rubber gaskets here.
117	597	You are gonna look back and you're gonna think, how the hell could my mom have been so irresponsible?
137	375	Can't you at least cut your hourly? I bought the snacks.
126	319	You know, I think what your uncles are trying to say is that it's learning that's important.
138	306	I'm, uh, just thinking out loud here, but if I wanted to steal a really valuable object, going in as a helpful soulvolunteering to test it might be my first move.
149	163	No, no. - You have to leave.
156	304	In fact, I can't find a single record to confirm either of you even exist.
137	1004	After what happened, she went underground.
164	265	the stronger gravity would hold a much thicker atmosphere...
150	178	If I couldn't work with women, I’d be dead right now.
115	874	I just want you to know that I understand how important kids are to you and that time is not on our side.
128	489	This is crazy to me, Rebecca. - Well, I don't understand.
132	382	Olivia, Kevin and scotty would like to talk to you.
113	634	For, according to the Weather Channel, and you can verify this on Google...
162	1768	And I could swear there were... wings.
128	90	Well, I want people to do more than just consider eating at our restaurant.
119	488	Yes, Kevin, it seems that she fixed you up with my brother, unbeknownst to both of us, and apparently, it did not go well.
123	323	So you're gonna go on television and play the victim and search for a book deal?
160	34	[ Phone Ringing In Distance ]
164	522	much like a squid might shoot out a big ink cloud...
132	713	Say bye to mama? - Bye bye. I'll see you soon.
130	286	I gotta see who this is. - Mom, your publicist can wait.
162	1574	Now, you should take these, once a day, and I'll get you more when they run out.
132	727	Yeah, I think. Uh, sort of, vaguely.
125	609	Yes... like monsters in your room.
163	80	Her father, peter, a widower, left her home alone for the weekend.
158	3	Of course l'm right. Go get ready.
147	249	That is, bar none, the craziest play I have ever heard in the field.
148	72	I don't know what she knows, but it's probably a good idea for you two to steer clear of me for a while.
150	240	Well, I’ll buy the drinks. - then you can definitely sit your ass down.
124	308	Li, in good conscience, I can't
165	128	Trust me or don't. It's your choice.
154	632	Yeah, well, I was nearly chopped to bits, almost blown up, and was shot today.
116	74	Oh, you know what? I canceled it. I-- you know, I just
163	620	You all couldn't wait to run over me, to take my position, to take my life...
135	633	Yeah. She just turned downsherman way.
145	123	Turns out that the phone used to call the village tracks to a hotel on South Beach.
151	25	Michael, what the hell is going on?
125	720	You know, you know, those buttons on the microwave are awfully confusing.
114	175	OK, first of all, you're beyond doors, babe.
164	588	Realize that in the coming centuries...
118	275	No, it sounds like some horrible, right-wing, militant, gun-tot...
132	442	oh, well, I told you not to wear those cute little shoes hiking.
155	1326	All you can do is tell your side of the story and hope for the best and know that no matter what you do, your fate lies in someone else's hands.
145	137	It's my wife, calling to complain about something or other. It's her specialty.
128	271	Will you watch him till the nanny gets here?
144	380	If you can convince your enemy to want the very thing it's as good as calling the shots yourself.
162	652	Are you sure you've got everything?
160	227	You should probably come get it， 'cause I can't fit my nunchakus in there anymore.
151	294	Good news is she's got your back.
149	85	Either way, we have to tell Madeline.
119	774	So, so, what's your name? -- Ken junior.
123	189	Kevin, your 4: 00 with Mr. Balanchine is here.
140	452	yeah, I'll take care of him.
122	423	Oh, apparently, your dear, deflowered little girl would've screwed my husband in a heartbeat.
124	39	Fine. I am here because I gave part of my liver to Elizabh.
120	740	Oh, Sarah, I'm so happy for you.
121	609	and so we just slipped back into our comfort zones.
131	327	I'll text you later. And work on that hook shot.
130	19	Come on, come on. Click "shoes" while you're thinking.
161	552	Yeah, Wade, boys, you really shouldn't have panicked like that.
141	189	I'm gonna take my hand off your mouth again.
119	529	First word... sounds like... sister. Mister.
115	52	I've already done "meet the press," "this week",
145	223	I'm sorry. I know. I know this hurts.
118	119	Mom, this is not a bus to Vegas, okay?
144	125	I've been running the name by all my friends.
127	252	So does the offer still stand?  - Yeah.
128	460	So you know what? This might be a blessing in disguise.
147	431	What did you do with the files?
147	244	I like it. I like it very much.
155	1276	You spun a web of lies to cover your ass.
118	122	Um, ch... Oh, never mind. Got it.
138	268	Jealous, fi? - Don't be absurd. I'm not jealous.
126	740	Actually, I didn't know Marilyn until yesterday.
156	646	You said Fi's out with Cody, right?
115	217	You remember you wore that costume to studio 54?
153	418	You get the first crack at Westen, but you better make it good.
128	146	Is it that bad? - Pearls?
161	642	Anywhere. Go ahead. You name it.  - Okay, good.
162	335	You're gonna take your shirts off. You can do it in skins, right?
161	692	Dear Mom, if you're reading this, it's very possible that I'm dead.
126	173	I think we would really wow the judges.
147	498	You stole the files from the island. Where are they?
113	437	Why are you shouting?  - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
124	651	I'm just trying to do what's best for Elizabeth.
148	688	I just need that one last piece, Michael.
154	305	Is that cool with you, Earl? - It's no problem.
131	569	Well, that was definitely more serious than the cheese lady.
115	306	Indeed I do, but I'm more than capable of eating by myself.
146	298	Bad guys, like most people, aren't big on checking the details in legal documents, which makes fine print a powerful weapon for a spy.
115	24	Actually, I was looking for Kitty, and she doesn't seem to be answering her phone, and I found, uh, your number on this contact sheet that she left here, so.
164	43	It circles around a little red dwarf.
112	205	This is half grown? This is only half grown, yeah.
119	86	Nora, look at the size of the thing. -- Yes, I see.
123	353	What's going on, Tommy? - We're leaving. Now.
136	580	After that, I’m 20 bucks richer.
118	579	You are... - I... I'm sorry.
132	44	Yeah, but this isn't a desk.
127	472	Listen, let me tell her, okay? I'm gonna see her tonight.
133	206	Jesus. You think Mikey'sukrainian made his move already?
164	436	and the chemistry that we think leads to the origin and evolution of life...
137	226	Well, I think the balls are in your court.
142	310	Deletes his text messages. There's no contacts list, either.
161	492	I'm a homeless U. S. Army deserter. I was...
118	112	Oh, I-I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
159	70	What are we gonna do tonight?
148	26	He's gone, Mike. And we lost our only lead.
129	300	Uh, I was actually here. I’m on my way back down to the city.
126	102	Do you mind if I come in? - No.
126	590	Okay, so how do I make it up to you
164	423	But what would happen on a world where there was even more water a lot more?
144	589	Are you sure we'll be able to see the house from here?
123	409	Even last year, even with William's death, amidst it all, tre was always this sense of...
163	92	Exactly the same. - Word for word.
126	275	And she's not gonna find out. - I'm sure she'd understand.
113	1495	and we will wait and wait in that space.
142	127	Just open a joint bank account with Mike and a mayor's aide.
161	3	Not you kids. Please, go to class. Go, go, go. Get away from me.
119	658	Come on, daddy! -- Okay. Okay.
117	229	You know, maybe we should think about selling this place.
135	693	Well, maybe one day you'll tellme what it was really about...
148	491	He's right. W-we need to go.
128	107	Sarah, who actually wants my help, has asked me to look over the Ojal drilling contracts.
142	287	3 something. - 3. 1, 3. 2, 3. 3?
163	185	This week, the football is all anyone cares about.
147	386	Call me a traitor again, love, and I'll end you.
142	45	This is real. Okay? Things are finally breaking my way.
127	345	Green card marriage?  - Shh!
144	625	I'm Michael Westen. I'm here to save you people.
132	447	God, you are a cross between martha stewart and joseph stalin.
152	44	No. No, Fi. You are not getting anywhere near this.
112	342	Francis and I are now 55' up, about the sixth floor of an office building.
146	254	We may only get one chance at this.
131	443	Karl had the most wonderful book signing today.
150	47	See me? -  There you are.
137	791	The people who shot Cowan are probably watching her place.
132	385	I guess you know why we want to talk to you.
151	199	Okay, well, that's a problem, see,'cause if Ed finds out about this car, he'll know where his wife is.
129	335	Luc, Darling, you were amazing. - Me?
115	343	And I didn't think what I did was heroic.
150	338	You of all people can't let that happen. - And if I don't do it, you...
113	440	Stay away from that girl.  - You don't need to take care of us, Amma.
140	43	Mm, Carla said you might be difficult.
151	164	She was closing in, and...Did I mention her eyes?
136	338	Old school -- You know i like that.
153	216	Michael Westen getting married. - boy, that's a good one.
131	279	You ran for the united states senate.
155	745	Enough of this "do whatever it takes" crap.
131	335	It's an event where potential parents can meet and interact with children who are looking to be placed into families.
113	983	That's what I was trying to protect you from.
128	448	Oh, and guess what. - What?
134	687	I just needed to know how connected Strickler is.
154	327	Okay, well, that lock will hold them for a bit, but, Mike, Vanek sure seems motivated.
123	343	You boys are goin' down. - Yeah, make it four.
132	507	Uh, no. He has a girlfriend.
132	536	I just wanted to say thanks for offering to help.
164	277	and that's how these organisms must have felt.
123	349	Julia's in trouble. - You've been here 24 hours, and you think you know what's going on?
155	214	All units report in. - You hear that, Westen?
129	119	Yeah, absolutely. - Oh, thank you.
118	280	And I certainly don't use taxpayers' dollars to gas it up. - Oh, no, no, no.
147	154	He's torched more than his fair share of villages to the ground.
119	672	No mother would ever call her daughter Juliet Capulet.
117	261	Den... What are you gonna do, beat him up?
120	51	It was, Sarah. It went really well.
163	77	I'm sure that this friend of your aunt's is very concerned, but it just doesn't work that way.
123	12	Sweetheart, you have to take something.
111	460	Don't... don't touch it. It's right here. Look.
142	374	Hey, Mr. Davis. How's it going?
145	263	Get him relaxed, get him talking.
149	49	She really wants another double date with Benny.
135	27	Fi, right now he'sthe only dance partner I have.
124	323	I thou st youron was in the shower. - Her other son.
131	153	The cover-up is worse than the crime.
123	202	Okay, what happened? Did you get nabbed shoplifting mascara and a thong?
154	406	Well, take your pick. We either jump through the blades of death or face the firing squad.
155	484	I know, Fi, but I'm not going to crack this guy unless I get into his head.
118	754	We should just let mom and dad do it.
151	374	Whenever's fine with me. I got nothing but time.
128	92	Ask him. He's the one with the money.
146	382	I don't have them with me. A guy he tips me off.
111	270	For what? I don't know, just...
147	53	I know what this is. - You know what what is?
132	715	They were in a box of William's things in Holly's garage.
130	470	I don't know. Probably sitting in some dark room someplace hating my guts because you so lovingly led her down memory lane.
139	306	You'll have to bear with me, Joe. - Joseph.
123	359	This summer, right after my sculpture phase, but right before dabbling in French.
152	571	Take care of this son of a bitch Duke once and for all.
112	450	And what could be more fantastic than a Kraken-size tentacle hook?
123	361	You know, I tried to, um...
153	140	If you need to escape a parking garage, the limited exit points can be a problem.
113	1229	All it said was to reverse the curse, I need to do these certain rituals...
150	144	Sam that someone might know what Anson's up to.
151	283	Oh, some folks last week from up north?
128	246	Don't worry. We're leaving. We have to practice for a tennis tournament.
129	358	Um, Devon, yes. Uh, so what's your question?
136	462	Sam , I thought you were supposed to handle that.
164	109	towards the twilight zones as the breezes move.
115	299	Oh, god. We went to the cyclone bar and grill, where we got horribly drunk, and I think I ended up dancing. Uh, you don't want to hear that story.
123	647	No, it wasn’t. - Yeah, it was.
158	364	This is my life we're－ Guy－ Guys－
137	574	This may be kind of hard to get your head around, but this is a good thing.
134	531	Quinn. - What are you doing?
155	583	Look, I want you to take a couple of these.
117	219	Not even with your wife? Mnh-mnh.
117	671	They're gonna think you're a terrorist.
151	371	Look at you. A mover and a shaker.
130	498	Which, of course, actually explains why you would suddenly want to go into business with your stinky old sister.
112	409	And I think we need that for our Kraken.
163	154	Well, Kelly's parents are in there. We still haven't been able to track down Brooke's father, pet E.
147	473	You really think you can sell this? - I don't have much choice.
151	576	They gave it to Eddie since we never got a real divorce.
146	263	What the hell are you doing here? - Why aren't you picking up your phone?
130	664	So what, you're suggesting we go off to some cozy restaurant, just you, me, and the in-laws?
139	404	Well, I'd love to, Mike, but, uh, there's some issues here.
163	645	I like being the person the family can turn to.
141	418	The vet will take very good care of both of you.
164	290	But the odd thing about these arms...
128	93	Well, I've often thought about opening a restaurant, and this would be a perfect time.
150	312	Yeah, Sam? - Mike, bad news.
139	93	Okay, all right, uh, okay, I got a reputationin certain circles as an expediter of getaways.
132	307	Well, what's this, part of the door?
155	586	Cellular-phone technology has come a long way in the last 10 years.
116	457	You know, I feel like I'm getting to know my dad all over again.
129	136	Well, I’m-I’m so excited to be here.
115	215	Yeah, well, it was queens, New York, for Europe in the middle ages.
161	825	Yo, dudes, that was awesome!  -Thanks, man.
146	98	Okay, Mike, get yourself a massage. Do yourself a favor.
126	432	I'm gonna go, uh, go find, uh, Rebecca.
111	185	She looked pretty shaken up, but...
150	70	A covert organization that does things you happen to disagree with?
137	143	Yeah, a buddy of mine, he's got a process that recycle stitanium golf clubs.
164	325	They may never hear the pholis coming.
120	588	So, uh, I think I need totay with her.
129	75	You know, before, it was all about helping rich people keep their money, t telling a squillionaire that he can't afford a second yacht isn't exactly the same as telling someone with a disability he's not gonna get his benefits.
162	169	Evolution. Do you see how the head changes shape to hold our big brains?
141	421	I don't know where you come up with this stuff.
127	703	York? No. No, he was staying at a hotel downtown.
128	829	No one ever told me that, and I... I just wanted to make sure I - I told you.
137	1032	Look, there's this sweet little park in coral gables.
146	398	I was on this boat yesterday. - I told you that Carter is mixed up with the cops.
124	176	I just know she's gonna have questions, and I want to know what our answers are gonnbe.
148	328	We got to get back. Holcomb's gonna be pissed!
118	315	This place looks like a frat room.
122	578	You want a near beer with that?
156	210	I'll get the accounts for you, but you got to tell Mike to watch it.
159	416	No, we'll just get it from my trust.
160	348	[ Kip ] So, how long are we talkin'about workin'?
115	743	Why. Why am I leaving? I forgot.
125	188	Kevin, I really. - No, I'm sorry. We'll talk about this later.
118	31	Um, honey, don't forget about tomorrow night.
145	398	Looks like your ma got what we needed.
156	61	Sonya is our only way in.
118	683	Thank you. - And if not, Sarah can support you for the rest of your life now that she and mom are the water queens of ojal.
154	392	Uh, I don't know if you can hear what's going on out there, but I hear a motor. Definitely sounds vehicle-ly.
149	104	He could stand to mend some fences.
113	1332	Excuse me. As the Ancients have foretold...
150	390	Listen, I’d help you if I could, Sam.
158	426	and say you'll be wearing something appropriate to your new vice president title.
158	271	Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't do that.
132	199	And I unplugged the wi - fi so she couldn't get online.
120	139	And--and Gordon and Wade, they're not so bad.
164	88	The achoms are a bizarre little creature.
127	201	I'm trying to figure things out...  - It's okay. I get it.
113	1013	Go away, go away, go away, go away!
156	648	Okay, pull up all the footage you got of him in their office...every last frame.
161	674	All right. Hit me in the chest.
156	541	Skipping town? What are you talking about?
130	76	Six. - Five and a half.
119	380	I generally just leave my car idling at the curb.
122	12	Joe, I want you to come home.
128	407	Luc, come on. You question my tennis game, my parenting.
154	665	I'm gonna be on the opposite side, you know.
124	726	You gotta quit that by the time you get into boys... or girls.
156	620	Last I checked, I was the best hacker you had, so what I was up to was making you a lot of money.
137	125	Now, when was the first time Melissa ever talked about her new friend Dave?
147	42	It's the new glass-bottom boat that that they're running out of Coconut Grove.
161	109	Wade, this is Drillbit. Come in. Wade?
145	381	Did you give him the drugs? - Yeah, I did.
156	743	The files are locked on the server, so...
119	713	You'll learn plenty of new riffs by the end of summer.
117	322	I realize that neither of you had the guts to pick up my phone calls today and talk to me.
126	308	Of course you picked a robot. How butch.
159	124	In these troubled times, I would presume that safeguards might be your President's first priority.
112	419	Here we go. Stuck in there, we've got the beaks.
116	320	What I'm trying to do is check every possibility.
152	598	Now, are you here to admire the view or discuss terms?
119	546	Okay, Tommy. Tommy, come on. Go, Tommy!
147	376	My company has fronted you $10 million. - It's safe!
161	555	All right. I'm... I'm sorry, but your boys brought a fugitive onto school property threatening the safety of my students.
125	139	I mean, I'm--I'm gonna go to an event tonight at the Reagan library.
164	492	to a theoretical gas giant known as Yeneer g...
165	362	I could feel responsibility fall on me like.
136	395	I’d like to be a june bride.
144	147	I get it. He's a good guy.
131	92	There was a, jersey shore marathon on last night.
155	1154	Then get some better ones and twice as many!
112	261	No, look, let's just leave the armor off.
149	268	Good to see you, Benny. How you doing? Hey, listen. You want to join us?
111	330	He came here to kill Maya King.
150	593	So did i. You lied to me.
126	363	So let's just stop butting into hers.
158	99	Time to go now. Oh, my God. All right.
120	218	You know, if this makes you feel uncomfortable no, no, no, no, it's--it's not.
156	337	What about someone from the inside?
126	98	Justin, if you are committed to seeing this through, You have to step up.
144	324	Tell them to come say "hi".
137	569	They're gonna be pissed, Kent! - Don't you think I know that?
137	1112	No, Fi. You need to go -- now.
112	166	And that will make it more agile, yeah?
112	145	These beasts are almost never seen alive.
161	777	Okay! All right, I'm 1 7. I'm a minor.
156	166	You could do it in your sleep, man.
137	973	I'm not sure what agency they are, but I need help.
159	47	It's some tradition. - Women have them, too.
129	40	Well, the producer wants the host to be a real mom with real mothering know-how.
129	168	I don't really think I’m a heart-shaped strawberry torte kind of gal.
122	291	I wish I had known that when we met, because I wouldn't have wasted my time.
116	623	Why-- why did this have to happen to me?
132	37	Yeah. - Slow around the corner! Slow, slow, slow.
147	384	You know, maybe he's not worried about anyone stealing it because he's the one helping Cahill.
147	618	I knew it. You are so bad!
142	19	I was dragged out of bed by someone very interested in you.
150	313	We found Anson's stash. We had it in our hand, but he - he had trackers on everything. He rigged the building to a detonator!
145	358	You are not going back in there. You are done.
136	314	You son of a bitch! -I can explain, baby.
147	414	If you do it right, the sodium will react with the water, and you've got the distraction you need.
140	233	He's got another for a car wash.
155	967	But if it doesn't work, Sam, Riley would have -- Mike, if this doesn't work, we're all screwed.
126	458	She went to look at some booths. Why don't you go and look at some, too?
122	46	I don't know. It doesn't matter. Whatever it is, we'll deal with it.
149	474	That one of his own men has betrayed him? Like a sabotage play?
136	193	We have a mutual friend up in new york -- Paco.
140	57	Seems the folks that burned me want me for a new errand.
155	312	The interrogation technique known as the prisoner's dilemma involves turning two prisoners against each other and seeing which one cracks first.
123	553	Julia wants to take the baby and go home with her parents to arizona.
153	228	Nifty. - Yes. It is. Nifty.
151	355	Mike, this thing is held together with duct tape.
164	612	the Earth would be nothing but a head of a pin compared to the size of the Sun...
131	411	You haven't seen them since christmas. - Right.
150	52	Either way, they go to great lengths to keep their regular life separate from their covert lives, keeping their secrets far from view.
165	524	Now, if there's a shore party waiting for us on the beach,
127	349	Would you... would you please go away?
145	276	What do you say we venture out of this bar?
151	168	The closest helicopter-tour place is in Flamingo. It's about an hour away.
116	116	You have to ignore him, okay? I'm being serious.
158	6	And these setbacks could just be opportunities.
130	79	What do you think? - Oh, Sarah. It must be so wonderful for you
126	469	Mom, could I talk to you, please? Listen. - Yes.
113	312	He's leaving.  - Hello, sir.
161	659	That's what I'm talking about!  - No, no, no, no.
123	3	Given Justin's history of drug addition, he is completely against taking any narcotics.
160	88	Look, tonight me and your-- Kip, listen!
161	800	I lost it. No, no.  - Let me see it. Let me see it.
163	240	Gideon, it's from the football team.
158	649	No. Go away. lt's been great...
151	77	Rebecca, you didn't want to stick around to chat?
131	406	Yes, and Kevin is your son, yes, but
161	871	This has been the longest three weeks of my life.
126	560	You talk about how hard you study, and
120	551	Although, it doesn't matter, because toy is the best day of my life, and I would be happy with just tap water.
116	730	Just come on. Sit down. Let's change the subject.
155	544	But I'm not going to wait forever for you to do the right thing.
164	305	One of the most bizarre creatures on AG-143 is the pholis.
137	28	He's got a lady who's got some problems, so she called him'cause he's in special forces.
158	564	Cancel the limo. Get out of the way, please. All right. Now go.
126	636	All right, now you lost me.
147	308	Speaking of help... Where is this boyfriend of yours you went through so much effort for?
115	240	It's okay, but just remember that politics isn't our only time-sensitive issue.
158	468	Let's do this. Come on. l'm so nervous. l'm so nervous.
116	450	I-I know. I know. They think I'm deranged, but
137	247	Now you say, hi, I'm ray.
146	66	What do you want? What do you want? - Daddy?
115	34	Kind of like oil and water.
154	321	Now get this damn thing out of here. - Take it!
141	75	It wasn't old Lar who used you up and spit you out.
153	382	During an operation, you never want to make a move until everyone's on the same page.
120	367	I'm glad Gordon had, uh, had you join today.
113	1266	Can you get this turkey out of the refrigerator?
114	164	So, you know Aidan from the hospital?
149	329	You think Joseph's gonna let you back in here a third time?
123	167	Do you think I want to be standing here advocating you - using drugs again for any reason? - Then why are you doing it, mom?
165	330	What stories you will have for your children, Robinson.
118	194	You have to... You have to fix this. - Girls. Okay, girls. Stop. Just... Fine.
141	152	15 people watched Larry walk into an oil refinery right before it blew up.
127	257	Except, in this case, they might check up on us periodically, so we just have to make sure we look like a real couple.
162	883	Nothing, it's just something our son told me.
128	752	Well, we all go to war in different ways.
161	500	Pick up, Bob.  - Yeah, pick up, Drillbit.
125	46	I mean, yes. I am-I amabsolutely, 100%, totally and completely up for it.
132	119	David, look, go. All right? Just go to the airport.
150	61	You're in no position to make threats, Michael. I’m serious.
148	71	You think she suspects you're involved?
127	465	He must have surveyed thousands of acres...  - Mm-hmm.
112	176	I like the way you've combined and morphed the squid head with the octopus head, you know?
129	629	Not all of them. I have more.
120	771	I haven't checked out yet. - Really?
136	275	I like coconuts as much as the next guy, but I’m talking about something bigger than coconuts.
111	104	Just got a call... Sampson Trujillo is back.
129	425	Well, thank you so much. A lot of help you were.
152	241	Good luck explaining that this wasn't your idea.
155	1100	You called in a hit on his mom.
154	163	Why is he yelling at me?
149	154	Arnie's working a job up in Boca. We're your guys.
155	1294	You're going to kill us both?
162	602	What about this? It says here that dinosaurs descended into birds.
154	473	They're camping out in case we decide to go for a stroll.
126	403	He's at a benefit with an older, attractive woman on his arm
132	132	Now you were shadowing a paramedic unit that responded to an injury accident?
113	187	Since Lena Duchannes came to town. My mama heard she's from a mental institution.
130	168	We have to talk, Kevin. We have to find a way through this.
115	303	Well, then that means you and I can have dinner then, huh?
158	573	No way. The freak went on without us. [Mouthing Words]
154	126	One of the biggest challenges of being a fugitive is security.
140	168	Now, we're going to hijack the something.
145	427	I should be inside the restaurant.
131	661	Stop it. Stop it. I'm-I'm almost finished.
120	451	Before they get here, I want you to know, I expect you to fix this.
120	29	Nora, you have no idea what a pleasure it is to be working with someone with so much passion.
146	536	The smart move is running, and I got to be smart.
154	58	Madeline, this isn't like Witness Protection.
145	462	Why would they kill the girls?
140	439	You're a real wicked skinner, you know that, Jimmy?
128	83	No. Luc. Between you and Luc.
159	218	Where the hell did you get these?
123	601	Honey? - No, it's Lina. You know what?
111	200	All right, the laptop has the same serial number as the receipt we found in the apartment. We got to take this stuff in.
160	42	What do you need? - Can you just go get her for me?
127	315	Oh, isn't that cute?  - If he's late because he went to go pick up my high heels, - I promise you, I will kill you.  - Honey, the heels will be worth it.
130	630	No, Sarah. She will lose it. She will go nuts.
142	582	Yes. You know, Michael, it seems like
165	463	Mary port, Susannah's bay-- fat crab beach.
117	458	Um, 20% seems... Well, it strikes me as low.
158	270	Yeah, yeah. l hear ya. Later. All right. See ya.
130	63	Oh, my God. What is wrong with you?
145	244	If you let me go, me and my people will find you and only kill you.
150	564	Mike, at the risk of getting a beat-down, can you tell me what the hell's going on?
116	745	How can you keep telling Kitty to risk and do scary things if you're not prepared to take risks yourself?
113	1370	Welcome to the family, my darling, special girl.
150	594	I told you what you wanted to hear.
136	246	You want a drink? -It depends.
142	448	You see, it's always at the end, when everything's coming together, that people start making desperate moves.
130	493	I didn't... nothing. I didn't... - What did you say about me?
123	8	Now you know how hard it is to love someone who doesn't love himself.
116	236	I'll help you choose a dress if you reconsider having another round of chemo.
150	126	And this is Rebecca lang and Ryan pewter Baugh with the cia's field division.
152	114	I'll get him to take me to Quinn.
130	528	Well, I'm fine. I-I have nothing to say.
155	293	Look, you guys should just leave, okay?
122	155	And, yes, I am going home to see my brother who just got back from iraq.
120	808	When I met you 30 years ago, you made me nervous, and 30 years ago, I was 30 years younger.
115	618	They had families at home, not Lena.
125	182	She is not. She's my friend.
124	341	He's in-- he in his mood, you know? Good to see you.
152	479	A successful blackmail depends on the psychological state of your target.
142	478	You know, I dug through nine subsidiaries in six countries.
146	260	I can get your money next week. - Yeah, your skin sizzles right off your body.
124	519	Oh, my god. - Scotty, look, I can explain everything.
123	74	God, is there some sort of presidential aftershave you're wearing?
145	144	Marriage is like a loaf of bread.
163	73	No, no, not just me. The team here did.
140	569	Sometimes you've got to get creative.
125	56	Hey, uh, I'm sorry to interrupt...
164	174	A human, weighing in at 175 pounds on Earth...
128	413	And, Luc, you come over here for a minute.
117	155	I am not gonna use any of that money unless I am guaranteed that she will get a decent return.
119	753	At least we'd look like we had a purpose.
161	293	It's just I'm happy to be with somebody...
153	263	Maybe he's in CIA custody, wishing he never met me.
137	1008	He's got decent stamina, but everyone's got a breaking point, and I'm good at finding them.
151	84	You do anything stupid, I dump Sam's body in the swamp.
158	170	[Radio: Man] That's McFly, a new British invasion band
153	292	Listen, Riley, I guarantee you - Mike is not the bad guy here.
132	126	I've always wanted a night on the town in my scrubs.
161	842	Dear Wade, Ryan and little, tiny Emmit.
117	13	Frantic? Well, I am aging fast.
122	605	You just have to be patient, I guess.
118	669	Actually, I do, but not because I don't trust you.
132	204	I think we're upset because this happened on our watch.
164	308	on a pedestal platform that has scales underneath.
124	144	He gets to hang out and play video games all day.
113	1069	How could the boy break our spell? He has no power.
152	502	Yeah. But let's not call it that.
161	242	Tough thing about what I do is I can't let my guard down.
148	320	To improvise a weapon, you have to understand the basic principle behind whatever you're making.
131	536	You know, Kevin, just because you always have to diet doesn't mean that you should make fun of pele who have a higher metabolism than you do.
124	715	is that you're her father. So...
132	574	What if david only wants me to move there because he feels responsible?
119	108	Miranda, hi! -- Nora! How are you, oh, my goodness.
127	660	I think we can make it. Come on.  - Okay. Kitty Mccallister, Senator, 2010.
118	63	At least Rebecca got a job offer.
132	31	It's about 50 pages. Ba - doomp.
150	339	I can handle myself, Michael. - I’m with fi on this one, Mike.
148	275	Where are the guys? I need a guy. I need a "Jack Marsden".
146	198	You're listening to Trey now, aren't you?
113	432	Oh, Amma, what are you doing?
144	458	And use my C. B. handle -- "Smoking Mama".
160	352	All right, you just start a little earlier. That's all. - All right.
111	194	It's easy to project. I'm not projecting, Michael.
112	317	The next minute you're over the sea. Exactly.
116	70	Who needs adrenaline? I'm practically spinning like a top.
144	593	I'll just wait up here until Bailey pokes his head out.
130	702	Sorry. I couldn't take the tension. - Thanks for that.
144	143	Guy like you might need a favor from the FBI someday.
140	552	Right? - Look at you moving up.
137	1352	I was never good at taking orders, Sam.
150	597	Yes. I’m here to, uh, surrender.
137	455	Having a gun to your head is all about timing, finding the right moment to make your move.
129	164	People are usually too scared to even compete with me, you know?
147	24	Try accessing the U. S. counterterrorist databases, see if I can find something.
161	323	Hey, Don, first of all, that's not an old saying.
156	58	I promised Fiona that she wouldn't be involved in this.
161	672	Remember what that douche bag Drillbit taught us?
124	662	I, uh, I'm not sure how to say this to you.
154	31	Riley's coming after me now. She knows I'm helping you.
151	315	Oh, uh, well, Becky just loves paperwork, don't you, dear?
164	572	so that we could hear them...
150	433	No, he's gonna hurt more people – a lot more people.
123	448	The nanny story...is it ever gonna blow up in our face?
144	534	Michael's life is at stake, and all we have is a picture of a house?!
149	331	Why in the world would he do that?
114	426	Missed you at the shop today.
131	155	No. No, not literally. It... Thank god.
125	258	You want to see what we got for uncle Kevin?
126	607	I used two different types of metals-- copper and zinc.
114	39	You invited the entire neighbourhood? Are you insane?
164	285	they swoop down in hopes to not only drink...
122	705	is the whole tone your fiancee took when she called.
114	451	But he's a different story, solid.
128	226	What, like chicken soup? You know a hundred doctors.
119	439	She did not have them in high school.
164	541	they wait till it draws nearer and nearer...
117	714	Luc, Luc, Luc, that is a distinction that no one at this dinner party is able to make right now.
159	346	as desperately as you want to.
148	484	So I need everyone to go out the back way and head for the fence, and we need to go right now.
149	87	Just... I have a meeting with Pearce.
131	260	Hell, yes.  - Who's respondi?
112	193	Oh, my God, you see it's actually grabbing hold here.
136	523	I’m not afraid to pull a trigger if that's what has to happen.
159	188	So there's a rumor that Harold Simms is pushing for David and Richard to get the Karasz oil leases.
134	51	So, uh, it's all about the burn notice with you, isn't it?
113	485	God.  - Well, there is evil, Lena.
149	177	I knew it. We don't have the right specs.
159	291	and we'll give him whatever he wants.
137	853	By the way, it seems like she packed up and left early.
137	1350	I told you to stay away, Mikey.
164	235	collect under the sands from the sparse rainfall.
126	35	Do you think this is cosmic payback for me and Kitty, for when we were
152	411	You got to have a little faith that Mike knows what he's doing.
125	495	And I have to tell you, you might think about telling your children the truth about ol' pepele pewover at my house, because if they ask me who he is, I'm not gonna lie to the you know what, mather? Just don't worry about it.
116	386	I think this one is really beautiful, but I think it makes me look flat-chested.
155	34	A friend of Nate's must have come by earlier.
160	550	Well, hurry up, 'cause I gotta get Trisha.
119	43	was that some sort of fraternity brother kind of thing?
130	72	I'm sorry. - I'm gonna go to work, and, yes, I will help Paige with her debate.
136	385	Madeline said she was sure you could take care of it.
120	79	And each bottle, with our new organic label...
137	278	If we can get evidence linking him to the heroin, we can do our own blackmail
150	543	All we got's a couple pilots? No flight attendants?
161	13	Got half an orange with your name on it.
132	357	So no, stop. - Okay, so you haven't, then.
147	95	Agent Pearce, you look like you could use a nap.
161	746	Come on, Wade! You're like Rocky! Get back out there!
147	495	Vanderwall, where have you been?! And what the hell happened out there?
123	326	You taught me that timing is everything, and it's a good story, right?
112	73	We've just got to watch him, because he's...
129	382	Somehow lately, it's all been feeling a little
127	84	I'm just afraid. When Dennis York wants something, he always finds a way of getting it.
153	316	So if you really want to help Westen, you'll help me.
120	537	You all right? - Yes, I'm...
132	622	Do you know that my nephew and his husband are about to become fathers?
128	309	Yes, mom, I've been going to my n. a. Meetings.
131	484	I'm sure that would be a happy ending.
144	425	The Turks sent out a second hitter.
131	521	I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure.
112	143	IT COULD VERY WELL TAKE IT TO ONE SIDE AND TURN IT AND SO THE BOAT FILLS WITH WATER
123	83	What? Why...why are you giving me that face?
132	516	Well, you are. - You mean, I was.
137	909	It's cold enough to crystallize the metal in many commercial locks.
150	529	We need to kill her radio now.
155	231	No, no. Just take me to Schmidt's house and patch me up.
145	292	How many times do I have to listen to her droning on about hanging curtains before I end up and hang myself?
124	187	Yeah, which she won't let me forget. You know what?
121	476	Just go with it! - Okay, Sarah, what are you talkin...
139	476	And when I'm done, you'll never have to worry about Timo again. Trust me.
147	131	As an employee of the U. S. government, I'm probably not supposed to say this, but...Wow.
140	592	Do it myself? - I got a gun.
160	417	Have you asked anybody yet? - No, but who would?
130	302	So thank you so much for calling.
164	405	These are animals with roots that pick up and slowly move across the planet surface and anchor themselves back down swaying in the wind...
120	517	She doesn't Facebook or Twitter, and D.J.
146	392	You you told him about the photos? I’m not even supposed to have these.
146	454	Well, no. What are you doing? What are you doing?
116	368	And all you're doing is alienating every single one of 'em.
122	53	No, no, Wait, wait, Try again.
136	300	We'd have been out of here 10 minutes ago if you didn't argue about every little thing.
113	303	I didn't mean to. I just...
113	1465	Ethan Wate.  - Yeah, I know.
140	468	Now I got to kill my deals all my investors are lost.
116	632	Wh-why would you ask me that? That's crazy.
134	560	Wait. You want to pull that here?
140	300	Johnnie walker blue on the rocks for me and my friend here.
145	574	You should really stop trying, Max.
122	376	Yeah, I was 9 - oh, god!
145	429	Trust me -- Takeda's Yakuza buddies are going to be a lot less chatty if they think one of their fellow diners understands 'em.
154	655	I-I got a -- I got a guy in -- in Morocco that can set a new
130	712	I know. Just go in and get seats.
118	537	I'm sorry. I'm worried about you, Robert.
154	214	Can we make it through there? - You tell me. It's your piece-of-crap van.
141	120	I'm gonna tell you what I tell all my clients.
123	417	Let me pull another one for you, okay?
141	164	Are you trying to keep me away from Campbell?
160	152	Now watch this. I'm just gonna break the wrist and walk away.
147	228	Some guy from the NSA. - The NSA has a leak? I want a name.
118	389	I take it you've never been tested before.
137	645	What? What is it? - Go. Just get in the car.
162	249	She hasn't got one yet. Mum and Dad haven't had time.
126	593	Or... you could walk back in there with your head held high
155	82	You know what this looks like now is an unexpected drop-in from Michael Weston.
135	696	Michael, I-I know I said that I would go along with youon this job, but I don't want youto work with strickler...
132	420	You've already decided that I've done something inappropriate, so why don't you just go ahead and punish me?
124	213	Not really. But it could be.
153	281	They didn't even have time to lock up.
150	474	I don't care what it is.
120	447	Yeah, but now is not the time to cut corners.
146	180	It's like squeezing juice from a stone.
154	539	Schmidt told you those passport chips were untraceable, right?
131	518	How far out are we? - Three minutes away.
154	582	Yeah, not so fast. I have a few conditions.
161	575	Yes! He has a samurai sword - he has used on his other victims!  - All right...
122	81	Mom shouldn't drive herself down there. She'll break the land speed record.
146	201	It's a little like being in high school.
112	130	I BEGAN SAILING FORTY YEARS AGO
147	362	Now, until we find out whether or not Mr. Cahill was working alone, we will assume that our radios have been compromised. Is that clear?
135	153	What, you don't think amy -- I mean, come on, she's, like, my special lady.
120	297	Kevin, I can barely hear you.
111	368	So, he wanted Maya to move? Yes, but she didn't want to.
112	45	If you ever found, you know, a 100' Kraken that had the strength that an octopus has, that would just be an absolutely fearsome beast.
119	704	Yeah, well, that was 10-plus years ago, and I'm still not over it.
112	168	All right, I'm going to add the squid fins, but I'm going to keep the octopus arms just 'cause they
114	26	Slice 'em, dice 'em, rue 'em.
146	393	Give me those. - okay you need to ease up on the attitude.
118	552	So, um, you all have your menus.
127	139	Oh, Saul, Saul, you could marry him.  - Yeah, I could marry him.
128	132	She after an endorsement from Hix?
129	623	I don't have the time to put this little a. m.Radio thing in my life.
141	303	If those guys are planning on getting to her here, you're just gonna have to find another way, right? Thanks.
140	211	Their main vulnerability is that they depend on people's faith in padlocks.
156	136	Sam and Jesse are already inside.
154	141	It's not like that. - Yeah, really? It seems like that.
146	538	You want to live the rest of your life in a shack in cuba?
112	478	Sorry, but I just have to put my killer hook to the test and see how much damage it can do, something the esteemed novelist Victor Hugo contemplated back in 1866.
116	222	Sarah, the only person who had cancer in our family was Daisy.
162	259	You mean, with no clothes on? With his tackle hanging out?
124	321	How was it having all those little kids look up to you?
115	212	Wait, mom, how have I never seen this movie?
145	44	All it would take is a few pictures with the wrong woman...
125	230	Stay there. You turn around like this. Okay?
148	112	Enter Michael Westen, a.k. a.Matt Graham.
129	632	You didn't hear my children calling in trying to save their mother from embarrassing herself, did you?
144	304	I'll tell you where he is.
132	131	We're investigating an incident that occurred last week.
147	462	Jackson expected you to kill us.
147	195	Let me go! Help! - Stop fighting.
153	560	Fuller, do not take the shot. I repeat, do not take the shot.
123	96	I'll go along with whichever you decide.
111	477	Let's see what we can do, okay?
145	573	All you can do now is look towards the future.
117	325	Sarah and I are pretty convinced that Kevin is not gonna be coming to dinner.
130	269	David, look me in the eye.
144	461	Oh, Mike's in a bit of a bind.
122	318	Now are you gonna stand for his legacy to be slandered by these people?
147	52	On three. One, two... - Put the gun down.
153	377	I'm sorry ... which one? - Lemonade is good.
137	1101	I'm not leaving you! Michael, I'm not afraid! - Mom, please!
124	600	Oh, Tuesday. - What, that's not good?
122	538	Thank you, that was... really sweet.
151	187	You think he reported us with telepathy?
153	180	It won't be long before they set up a perimeter and block the causeways.
154	312	The Mercury fulminate in a blasting cap gives you the perfect amount of explosive to send the message loud and clear without killing the vehicle or anyone in it.
162	170	Did I say, "big brains"? Maybe I should qualify that, Mr Coot.
120	390	Since I've got here, I've either been coddled like some half-wit or straight-out insulted.
117	48	And this is something I have to work through myself.
128	323	Luc, you said that you would keep an eye on him while I got changed.
144	586	We'll find out if you're lying right now.
129	171	I’m trying to reenact our—our first date.
115	651	If you have A. -I'll kill you.
152	211	Everybody knows - Do me a favor- shut up.
132	700	Hey. Hey, come on up here.
117	181	Well, I wish Kevin felt like that.
126	64	Kevin, don't be weird. - Sorry.
121	613	he's like all the men in my life.
112	154	So far it's looking a lot like an octopus.
123	269	I just...I-I don't think I feel comfortable trying to convince him to take drugs.
145	533	Three men there. Password -- nihonto. Hurry!
131	672	It's because of her - Her... Vulnerability.
117	712	She felt like she had to not want to.
123	468	I do, okay? But I can't help it.
132	730	That's probably why William had you followed.
137	1244	You did a lot of things I didn't understand.
155	64	You remember your old neighbor, Raymond Mosley, also known as sugar?
122	523	You know, I would keep him off the leg for a while, and he's gonna hate you, he's gonna fight you on it, but it's best if he doesn't put any pressure on it for at least two weeks.
155	547	So...think about what your mom would tell you.
133	227	Two boring hours of driving later, even the sharpest killing machine  lets down his guard.
137	1190	Maybe you should draw me a picture of the map to that park.
162	344	Just take them. They'll make you feel better.
131	625	Listen, um, antiques lover, I...I hate to say this, but it sounds to me like you and your girlfriend are just... Not a good match.
154	555	Maybe we can put something together and blow through one of these walls.
117	470	But it was always about William Walker and nothing else.
124	719	all right. Look, I'm gonna go help mommy.
127	505	W... well, yes, Robert, of course. That's what we're doing here.
113	339	Then why don't you go make us some tea?
149	500	I don't know who or why, but it's the only explanation, 'cause your men are the only ones with access.
151	255	Madeline, it's good to hear your voice.
148	659	This should make you feel better，it's gonna take time to make sense of the information.
132	14	Would you like to sit down, Olivia?
125	37	Imagineyour white blood cellsare hurtling towards a cancer cell"...
147	189	Well, then, we'll have to think of something clever, Sam.
163	186	That didn't always sit right with Kelly.
149	358	You just figure a way to get there. I'm on it. Thanks, Mike.
126	260	Holly. Just out of curiosity, when we last spoke, um,
153	590	Now that I know your side of the story, I want you to know...
112	201	The guy who studied it most is Steve O'Shea, an authority on all things squid.
146	436	Of course, that's the Same reason that spies live in fear of the day they accidentally accuse one of the good guys
129	39	Justin. - I’m kidding. You're gonna be amazing.
140	45	They're into the whole carrot-and-stick thing, and...
148	375	You said he worked in maintenance.
136	10	You know spies -- A bunch of bitchy little girls.
132	653	But you guys don't know who I am.
159	412	what do you think he would do if he found out about this?
152	249	Relax. The tracker says they're getting to the motel right about now.
129	31	Um, really? That's funny.'cause I think I just heard you talking.
150	85	I thought we agReed - Fiona, it's like I told you before.
137	741	A warehouse door is going to be reinforced, but the walls aren't.
118	601	She said Robert's gonna be all right.
111	225	Come on, man, look, we know you brought Dion's items into the pawnshop.
155	65	Riley took him into custody and threw out the rule book.
137	1088	Look, I was hoping to get you home in a couple days, but that doesn't look like it's gonna happen.
152	275	What, you think I'm taking you to Quinn?
154	401	Damn it! - Can we stop it? Just stick something in it?
131	479	And I can't imagine how it feels for them.
132	424	I would be very careful if I were you about maki this any worse.
114	560	Yeah. So you wanna grab some lunch or something?
119	356	I was the chick singer, and I never really knew what to do with my hands, so I picked up a guitar and learned enough chords to fake it, but that's about it.
146	531	What are you insane? We're not going anywhere near there.
119	52	Ah, I looked for you at the announcement.
150	90	Knock it off, both of you!
145	237	You cooperate -- I'll let you live. You don't
112	353	This is scary as hell, dude.
128	56	Okay. Yep, do it. Thank you.
161	518	Oh, really?  - Yeah, it is, Don.
154	605	We can't. We go in now, the bad guys will see us coming a mile away.
137	20	No, the bucket of trans fatyou got there.
130	506	See, you do that. - You set me up...
137	579	And now they've got a big box of heroin they have to get rid of.
164	431	have been created by scientists, based on knowledge about the development of life on Earth.
130	572	This is the ring that you gave me when you asked me to marry you, isn't it?
163	9	What are you doing? You hate football.
127	203	I've given up the senate seat.
131	555	No, no, no, Karl, sit down. Sit down. Sit down.
111	337	I'd like to, but I don't know why I should help Myron.
138	93	His name is tyler Brennen, a black-market trader.
131	91	Oh, great. We'll call him Vinny.
148	524	Fuller called from the control tower.
136	525	You got a better idea? -Yeah.
113	382	But I'll never make enough money for her, so I'll start drinking...
161	742	Good one, Ron!  - Come on!
151	573	She died while I was in here.
130	225	What are you talking about? I have... I have directed a staff.
130	349	Yeah, believe it or not, it is the approved name - for the hormone that causes our fight-or-flight response.- Really?
118	156	I'm already hearing this crap about Kitty using my plane to campaign around the state.
111	480	He's our best chance to get Wilson. Without him, we got nothing.
154	630	I'm just glad it worked. - Come on, get up! Shoot them!
132	646	Outreach. How can I help you?
132	410	before you start yelling at me, will you just ...
147	467	Earth to Vanderwall. Why isn't Jackson still here? Think about it, man.
155	935	A CIA officer sends a drug cartel after us? - Yeah.
136	436	You've been in the business  way too long when you recognize the sound of a . 45 caliber over a phone.
113	563	Uncle Abner, we are in need of your intercession.
123	644	Jus! - Well, if it isn't tiny tim.
116	485	I'm-- I'm really sorry. - No, no, fine, go.
145	605	I was hoping... you could... put your snow globes on it.
152	471	Mike's got to be meeting with Quinn just up the street here,
136	129	Mike, look, I can sweeten the pot on this.
152	476	Signal's coming from right over there where that garbage can is.
111	28	You know, I drove him everywhere.
123	65	He could have trouble walking, running...
142	90	You try to escape, Nate dies.
158	8	Because when one door closes Two others open.
125	82	She has her own line. She's looking for investors.
136	82	They took everything that she has.
112	111	A speckled brown animal with a broad head and arms that fluctuate like seaweed.
151	305	First, we get out of here, then I'll figure out what's next.
158	207	Oh. No, no, no. l couldn't. No. No. Honestly, l think you should have it.
112	354	I know that you're used to this, but this isn't my bag of tea, you know?
158	450	Um, actually, l'm not. l have, um, a meeting.[Door Opens]
148	635	When you get Gronbach, you take my cut, you send it to my mom. She's in the old-folks home in Homestead.
154	75	Making a fake I. D. that can reliably cross a border these days isn't just a matter of getting special paper and a hologram sticker.
145	92	Apparently, happy hour is more important than saving innocent young women.
112	221	Because that's the only way you're ever going to actually see it,
134	461	Mr. Carson filled us in everything, including yesterday's incident.
114	447	Or new place. I guess he moved back.
151	176	Seems like you're forgetting who's holding the gun.
148	130	Second, I said I was sorry.
125	362	He's the first chef-artist-dancer-swimmer that I have ever known--a true Renaissance man.
114	497	Maybe you're not trying to move on.
146	603	Fi, I’m not losing my mind.
137	664	You think this is about me?
114	91	So, vampires brush their teeth, but they don't eat?
150	575	Sam! Sam, what happened? Where's fi?
128	451	You should've seen us on the court today, uncle Saul.
164	562	filled with biological creatures of all shapes and sizes...
133	91	Unless the ukrainian cuts your tongue out first, right?
118	13	And... And, robert, are you not... Are you not packed?
114	573	Come on in. - Thanks for calling.
155	626	I'm going to get up now, okay?
155	367	How about I erase all the question marks from your once-sterling record, get you back into cifa with a clean slate?
125	295	All right. He's handsome in an obvious sort of way. But that's no reason to act like a bunch of teenagers.
119	648	I'll get you in a minute, yeah can you please tell me what the hell is going on in here?
129	297	No, I just know the feeling.
130	453	To make it all about me.
150	602	Because I’ve always known your heart.
155	750	Sam, I'm... - don't do it, Mike.
134	129	Even if you could reassemble a colt m1911 and fire it, what happens after you shoot him?
127	433	It... it doesn't matter what it is.
155	176	Sam, Riley's here. She's sending some guys your way.
129	223	What did you say? - It's great.
129	448	Okay, so prove it, because the Nora Walker I know would pulverize that big-haired windbag.
123	89	I...I think she'll drag you there.
116	722	Here's something to help you guys pay for the baby.
146	213	You've been waiting on this yogurt lady's boat for what a month now?
147	237	There wouldn't be enough time for help to get here.
115	211	I thought maybe you were gonna call me.
162	416	See, you've just got to try.
155	945	If Riley's really coming after us with a cartel kill squad, shouldn't we be trying to stay, like, as far away as possible?
122	359	Do you need, uh, coffee or anything before I get started?
146	18	By the way, mom thanks you so much for the "welcome home" meat loaf.
164	270	And what we see in the fossil record...
162	222	I'm absolutely knackered, me, but I'll be dancing again soon.
113	831	And look at what I am now.
141	92	Jeannie anderson -- she is our "dead-ee".
120	664	It's just...the pills I took for--for the headache, which…I really did have.
113	982	She has no love for you.
113	635	there were unseasonably strong gusts from the east...
132	671	Well, you're all set. The car is packed up and ready to go.
150	388	So, how does it feel to be back in the saddle?
116	125	Ignoring a racist is taking the high road?
129	110	No, not at all. - No, no, no.
149	211	The company that leased the chemical plant also rented an estate over in Cutler Bay.
153	419	I'd rather end this thing peacefully, but I'm prepared for any outcome.
112	273	The Soren Larsen, it's about the same size as the tall ships that sailed in Scandinavia back in
124	220	Yeah, I did,'cause, uh, I-I-I saw you because you--you were here.
137	23	No, you can binge in peace, Sam.
140	434	We're going for a little ride tomorrow. Doesn't that sound like fun?
154	220	Fan out! We're not leaving without Schmidt!
114	10	Tell Bishop what happened last time was a mistake.
164	625	this rise of the machines may even happen on a planet closer to home.
117	115	And it's Kevin's birthday. I have to cook.
117	401	When the whole world is shifting and changing, you've gotta hold on to your carrots.
117	365	Our family business is about to be sold off for a fire sale, and I don't seem to be able to stop it.
119	716	Uh, no. I think I'm done with school...
160	225	Cause you're not. You could be drinking whole if you wanted to.
141	271	Then I had to watch it come back.
161	684	I'm not gonna tell you where I'm gonna hit you.
145	162	Son of a bitch has 20 girls locked in a box somewhere, and he's lounging poolside. Check out that missing digit.
144	212	Got visited by a hitter who had a modified Saiga-12k just like this one, and you sold it to him.
114	408	A door shows up. We kiss goodbye.
161	428	Get out of my house, you asshole!
118	536	That's why I chose you. That's the whole point.
145	453	Yes. That is mine. Thank you.
117	174	And that's not gonna change in time for his birthday dinner.
118	473	You have a surrogate carrying your child.
113	185	As we feel him coming towards us...
154	684	He wanted to take you to a better place, Ma. He wanted you safe.
146	537	Listen to me! I was right about Carter, wasn't i?
162	32	But it was a week before they found him.The smell drifted down the whole street.
147	187	What the hell does he care what truck it is? - I'm sure he has his reasons.
125	235	Kevin, what the hell is the matter with you?
141	623	Jesus, kid, put your hands down.
163	41	Well, if he knows us, why hasn't he talked to us?
120	572	Because you are ridiculously smart, and yet you have no idea how hot you are.
120	192	Well, right now I don't really have time to open any more lines of communication.
161	511	I don't care about them. 1, 500.
122	629	My mom is being so... mom.
115	704	The only reason we never got another one after bingo.
155	1084	See, because I think you're going to tell me how to find Michael Westen.
119	586	How come I get stuck playing operation with Dr. Demento, and Justin gets to do that?
117	534	That I had to go? Yeah.
151	554	Cell check! Against the wall! Against the wall!
130	3	You know, F. Scott Fitzgerald ends "The Great Gatsby"with this line, "we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past".
159	413	Did you know the Party talked to him about endorsing you for a congressional seat?
131	282	Oh, yes, yes, yes, for the past five years. He's making a career of it.
115	454	The rice. Do you know anything about paella?
155	241	And then from the everglades, it was on to key west.
131	483	Well, maybe you could do one on the children who don't get picked.
113	184	Protect us from the devil, as we feel him approaching.
137	792	When you go get her, bring her here.
161	787	My hands are... My hands are still shaking.
127	89	Mom, where are you?  - Uh, just a second.
146	597	I mean, either you're going to find out that you're crazy, or maybe this thing with you getting burned isn't over.
144	18	So, your search for the root of all evil led you to rob a bank, and you're rewarded with the word of God.
140	139	Eddie keeps them locked up in his office.
158	233	[Man] Hey. lsn't that that bird from the bowling alley?
118	406	Oh, saul, did you put, um, vinegar in that water?
132	301	I mean, are you in your right mind?
137	478	Kent - - busted my wind shield.
124	118	Look, you know what? You're not gonna-- - could I get a napkin, please?
131	179	They're calling Seth her boy toy barista.
146	222	I just want my money. - Then let's see what he can do.
122	350	No. I'm madly in love with her.
152	262	A couple of guys up in Boston said that I could get to Quinn through you.
141	597	I'll follow and discover your body and call 911.
156	502	Call me when you're in position.
130	565	Oh, no, wait. I-I want you to hear what I have to say.
111	324	Maybe he had to kill her first before he could take out Dion.
147	432	Jackson took them -- back to Grand Cayman.
145	488	Where the hell are you, woman?!
160	161	Now, in addition to what you just saw...
130	619	You could turn them all into nasty little Republicans.
137	391	If you want to bug a cellphone wirelessly, you'll need a lot of specialized scanning equipment and a computer to deal with the encryption.
164	19	Prepare to take an intergalactic safari...
144	695	I'm gonna give those two morons a piece of my mind.
114	182	Cleansing breath and all that crap? OK?
137	1377	You sign up for the lifestyle or the chance to serve your country or the millions of frequent-flier miles.
114	439	And it's easy to get lost in it, caught up, consumed.
134	524	A 9-mil at this range –
121	397	needs, uh, more water right now. Thank you. - getting me some lentils? Thanks.
164	563	some scientists believe an alien world...
115	540	I mean, unless I absolutely have to. I'm kidding.
132	575	I can't keep dangling hope in front of them, especially rebecca.
119	731	they're like a force of nature. -- Yeah.
116	689	Just wait a second here. Look, hold on.
122	114	We don't want to underwhelm him either. - Yeah, I know. I--there's just something that
145	539	If he moves, shoot him in his good leg.
154	504	You can't! Vanek's guys are right outside the door!
155	1301	It's a creation of your own twisted mind.
153	320	I'm saying no jail time if you give me Westen.
152	728	I've been reassigned to Mumbai, part of an anti- counterfeiting task force.
150	458	Glad to see you made it back to the party.
151	248	And the sisters --they'll be on their way to the hole.
141	444	Well, you said that you were gonna kill me if I didn't call off the hit.
155	164	Nothing. it's all still pretty quiet.
112	135	WE WERE GOING AT ABOUT 24 KONTS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE BOAT SLOWED DOWN TO 8 KNOTS
114	111	Look, maybe the key to you moving on is moving past Danny.
151	323	If you're the hostage, you'd like to improve those odds, which means figuring out where your rescue's coming from and getting yourself out of the line of fire.
140	106	What? You're gonna... -Guys, yeah, thanks.
130	195	Is what happened that night was about so much more than cheating.
126	635	But what if he's not? What if he's getting the bargain
116	123	You attack him, you're gonna attack a large part of the base.
127	314	It's a little gun. "straight shooter
111	369	Pearl, why do you think Mr. Wilson would pay for everybody to be here?
155	651	Let me talk to Campbell. I'll call you right back.
141	63	I've got more work than I can handle.
116	171	All the old "daredevil" comics, "the avengers," "captain america," "the amazing spider-man.
165	533	They might make the same mistake I did and see him as a savage.
114	43	Josh, it is a party. Relax. Now.
130	637	Why didn't you tell me before?
155	1155	Listen, you want a pass from the CIA?
135	690	Michael, how did that businesswith the hotel cleaner turn out?
128	138	My hat is off to Kitty. It's a damn fine virgin run.
164	574	and the next step might be the development of thinking machines.
118	452	Okay, it makes sense, but I'm still trying to find out who it is.
148	332	Not to pry, but is there something with you and Mike?
119	428	How on earth did they get T-shirts made in one day?
144	635	There's a couple people six feet under that would disagree
161	758	Yeah. - What the hell are you even doing here?
150	461	You plant that card in Pearce's computer yet?
131	498	Mom, he's not in high school.
156	809	I know what it's like to work for you and Burke.
147	408	The quickest way to turn a security force's attention away from an outside attack is to make them think there's an even bigger threat inside their facility.
144	238	It's gonna smell like chicken in there, but I don't want you two to get hungry.
124	643	I agree that I will under no circumstance advise Elizabeth walker as to her true parentage?
158	423	l－ l don't know what to say.
159	250	Maybe she just sent them as a souvenir or something.
122	1	It's been 21 days, and I haven't heard a single thing from him.
165	317	Going off the canon shot, it sounds as if they found their way to Mary port.
144	47	It's about saving all those innocent people.
147	480	He just stole $10 million worth of our files. - Bastard.
150	109	Congrats. You're in charge of an official cia team for the first time since you got burned.
155	593	The software was made for tracking cargo containers.
146	474	Going to take him up to key biscayne, get the whole story out of him.
112	180	Well, if you want bigger and badder,
116	218	Sarah, I'm not blaming myself. I'm just taking responsibility.
116	473	My father was a philanderer, and when I look back, the only things I realize are the clues I missed.
150	342	Now, I’m - I’m trying to find a way out of this.
145	448	When tailing someone dangerous, it's a good idea to give yourself an innocent-sounding reason to be following your target.
132	397	I don't want you guys to be my parents.
153	274	It takes a little longer, but when you're trying to save a friend, it's time well spent.
118	769	Mom was just ahead of... - mom!
144	61	You sure we're safe riding out the storm here?
164	527	But creatures that live much deeper in the oceans...
160	92	We're gettin' low on steak, so I got Lyle comin' over tomorrow to take care of it.
113	1116	It's already started. I'm turning into a Dark bitch, I can feel it.
160	551	Hi. I got your 2 4-piece set right here.
137	788	Nate, I need you to go get mom and bring her here.
146	140	As long as they don't turn on each other, they're at the top of the food chain.
146	404	Thank you. - Too bad. They're mine.
159	487	"If she's pussy for hire, I'd start by hitting the streets".
147	606	Until I found out that he had "paid" to meet me by doing a favor for some of my associates.
153	512	Once authorities have flagged a cellphone, they can access every relevant piece of information stored on the device.
118	155	He hasn't anything on Kitty. - Then he'll make something up.
119	89	You are my Sherpa. -- I see.
129	583	If this is what you want your life to be now, sitting by the swimming pool and hanginout with models, schmoozing all night at hollywood nightclubs, I
113	534	I can feel it like a hand twisting my insides.
136	161	Yeah, i mean, I don't know a lot about printing, but something like that.
142	435	Nate was here, but he's gone now.
122	628	Now I know what I'm missing.
151	324	Of course, if your captor is every bit as trained as you are, even the slightest attempt to adjust your position might be noticed.
131	454	Karl, you like barbra streisand? don't you? - yes.
118	631	That means you don't have to do things alone. That's the whole point.
162	523	Oh! But say that you get too busy, or... or I'm out dancing, maybe, and we miss each other, just remember, them as can walk should walk.
130	593	I'm sorry, Kitty. I just... I lost my mind.
114	450	You and me, we're on the same plane.
124	707	Don't let uncle Scotty see you in that princess nightgown.
122	702	Were you as shocked as I was when your fiancee, Kitty Walker, accused honest abe of being a gay?
116	139	We're not drinking it. We're selling it.
134	516	and when to take it away.
132	168	Oh, right. The renters would love that having a crazy lady living in their kitchen.
154	674	Jesse already told me it's too risky to come here.
145	322	It's gonna knock you flat, but in a good way.
123	48	How did it go? - He'd be a model patient if he weren't so ornery.
132	79	Same place she was when I called you.
114	177	You can move with your thoughts.
162	1664	then my dad wouldn't have... Anyway, it's not true.
141	200	He, uh --he was very, very angry when I got written into the will.
113	188	She killed a boy on the train tracks in Atlanta.
161	216	I think she might like me.  - Yeah?
137	537	Think Kent's just gonna sit on the sidelines for that?
153	49	Had to? How do you figure that?
127	120	Oh, gee, thanks, mom.  - You... you and I have plans, Luc.
124	202	I'll take your pants off. Lift your butt up. Lift it up. Come on. Come on.
146	234	I like that you're so confident, but is that even possible?
148	664	I can't stall Pearce any longer.
141	68	Still a yogurt man, I see.
134	498	H-how'd you find him so fast?
147	422	If we're risking our necks while Mike is working on his tan in the tropics, he's gonna buy me two months' worth of mojitos.
126	80	I know. - We're actually gonna be dads.
111	452	3: 00. Okay, c-could we, uh...
153	608	I already talked to them. They came by yesterday.
147	238	As soon as the mercs find that Cahill's boat is still here, they'll know something's up.
123	345	You know what, ben? Your folksy shtick, it's...
144	182	Aw, Michael, that's so thoughtful of you.
111	468	That's okay. It's understandable. Just be yourself, and be natural.
146	95	I told you I spotted him three times. I couldn't take the risk.
113	769	Uncle Macon. How old and weak you look.
157	584	And when they're done with us, they're gonna throw us in some cia hellhole for the rest of our lives.
125	396	Robert, I spent two hours on my hair.
161	703	In case we don't make it, - I don't want to have any regrets.  - Yeah.
114	112	Like, what if you met someone else?
148	176	Once you're in, though, there's not much you can do but keep your eyes open and figure out just how bad the situation is.
150	565	It was a set-up. Rebecca was a plant.
113	386	Then when I'm 52, I'll have my first heart attack, another one at 63.
150	319	Wouldn't happen to be about a weapons facility up near tampa, would it?
164	77	a red alga or a bacteria...
146	589	You know where I was 11: 42?
124	636	we don't want that either, Justin. Come on.
131	510	Look, everything's gonna be okay. We just have to get your husband to the hospital.
115	588	No, the thing is that, Kitty, that mom likes him.
117	386	It feels like you killed the tooth fairy.
115	67	That's been hounding us for the last four weeks.
140	523	So pump 100, 000 volts into one from a taser,
155	1336	What are they... - They'll be released shortly.
149	88	This is gonna take a while. I need to grab a cab.
156	349	And I'm going to need plenty of yogurt in the fridge.
129	250	Now I know we all agreed to this 2-shift scheme of yours, Frank, but I talked to the station execs upstairs, and we all thought, wouldn't it be so much more fun if we went on the air together?
161	153	And you haven't been on a date in forever.
144	365	What do you think happens if I put Simon and Michael
126	28	Okay, you won't believe what happened. - Who is that child?
127	239	I don't remember anything, and if I do, - I will give you a call.  - Okay.
146	540	I mean, from where I’m standing, it's not even a choice.
146	261	Your lungs sear from the hot air. You gag from the smell of your own burning flesh.
111	543	Whatever you need, we're here for you.
115	75	Either we face this head-on, or we pack up and go home.
164	118	because its eyes wrap all the way around...
117	678	No. No, actually, it was an incomplete disaster.
158	43	Yeah? Oh, um, the waiter. He was just－
116	317	I mean, Rebecca, have you ever had your thyroid checked? Because hypothyroid can
145	174	Jesse, take the car. We'll meet you out front.
117	333	Why don't we wait until next year?
125	711	Food? Okay. - Me, too. I'm starving.
122	366	Funny. So what did you get Justin?
151	123	Pee break? - We need a ride your friends haven't seen.
156	759	The cops were already in there.
118	592	Look... I may have gotten myself into a situation.
113	1139	You've got to get away from me.
136	613	With an fbi tail? Are you stupid, or are you just trying to get us caught?
153	324	Mike's got a boat there gassed up and ready to get the hell out of Dodge.
116	397	Thank you so much for doing this with me.
125	161	I-I was just over at the Asian market trying to find pickled ginger.
148	142	Sam said you might be reluctant to help.
111	519	What you said the other day...
124	314	It's amazing. It's a concert of color and light.
156	143	The hackers work out of this building on Biscayne Boulevard.
132	703	Mama has to go away for a while.
132	591	Now how can I live without that? Okay.
129	617	They said they loved your honesty, they loved the way you talked to the callers as if they were your own children, uh, but I gotta tell you, bottom line, you were a lot cheaper than dr. Alex.
129	272	I’m not ready. I can't do this. I’m not ready.
124	243	You know, I should just fire Kevin.
162	1797	Nothing, it's just something our son told me.
123	378	One, two, three. - Careful. Careful. Careful.
136	98	They were in such a hurry to get my information --Credit cards, bank accounts.
141	29	The garbage someone leaves on the curb can often tell you more than a face-to-face conversation.
163	251	The person responsible spent considerable time and energy planning the abduction.
161	81	Drillbit, come in, please! Where are you?
122	247	No, don't--don't you dare. Don't you dare.
146	470	Found a stash in the wall at his place. - you mean the floor.
148	47	Most commercial security systems use magnetic sensors.
134	413	What, are you gonna ask some knuckle head off the street to fix this? No.
158	467	All right. Guys, guys. Final touches. Dressing room now. Come on.
130	507	Because I thought maybe you'd be able to... - Girls! Stop it. Girls! Stop it!
130	667	Are you sure you're ready for coffee?
140	590	Looks like somebody's gonna have to get his hands dirty.
121	81	They're really great, by the way. - Look, she's not a part of my life.
161	471	...if you look closely right there. Can you see?
117	67	I have to go. Saul and Holly called a meeting.
136	460	The fbi is back, I see.
119	636	Yeah, you know, for one minute, could you drop the superior attitude?
137	1152	You have a name for me?
137	608	All right, that's where Kent's little meet is going down.
119	344	Um, listen...I just had an absolutely genuine, totally unforced, 100% organic desire to call you to see if you wanted to come over for grilled cheese.
165	158	I went years without a companion.
136	153	The U.S.Government has no business --Yeah?
151	269	Nah. They won't pass close enough to the trees.
164	47	This habitable zone is a crucial piece of the puzzle when understanding the evolution of life on any alien planet.
115	569	I don't have time to discuss it. -I get it.
163	367	The guy was going through a divorce, the girl had a record.
113	742	Do I know you?  - Not a bit.
120	99	Well, that, too, but I-I was talking about balance between relationships and work.
124	68	So that the sunlight comes streaming in and then it reflects right off that stone.
113	186	Been hitting the same spot every night.  - Since when?
161	643	Everybody! Everybody! I'm gonna kick their asses tonight at my house!
124	518	I mean, look at me. - Right.
137	310	Look, Mike, I know you're busy, but I need a fresh face on this.
119	598	You know, phony neanderthal weasel who's ruined America, that kind of thing.
137	1143	And I should do this because...
137	713	Who did? - I don't know!
131	613	Oh, yeah. Yeah. It definitely... It was a bit of a tantrum.
118	439	Wine, please. Wine, please. - Here.
133	17	Bottom line --  as long as you're burned...
132	120	I will get the boxes in the garage, and I will get Holly to new york.
113	280	Unless you actually do think I'm a jerk. Then I'll just go.
137	384	I just thought you'd want the update.
132	372	Dr. Barnes, call 3 - 7 - 7 ...
151	456	You go a couple of miles, and you take a right, then you take the third left. You go down about a half a mile, and you see a no-trespassing sign on a property near the water.
137	1173	I'm ready to make a deal.
137	977	They follow your lead, go where they think you are.
153	157	My name is Agent Riley. I'm in charge of the investigation here.
154	289	It's gonna be fine. Maddy, just -- just do it like we planned, okay?
150	584	She's turning herself in? - Yeah.
142	469	Sam, if we don't find something to use against Brennen, I'm gonna have to give him what he wants.
128	651	You can't walk away from your life, Justin.
132	478	Are you guys done? - I don't know. Are we? No.
144	520	And if you're already daydreaming about retirement, you're not cut out for this kind of work.
125	408	You're a miracle worker. - Thank you.
128	478	A huge backyard, a swing on the front porch, built-ins in every room... It was perfect.
129	204	You want to try? - Yeah.
127	659	Can we still make it?  - I don't know.
132	500	Even though nothing bad happened. - Paige.
141	161	I need to speak with Jeannie alone, preferably some place quiet.
153	561	Agent Riley, confirm your order to stand down.
122	319	You know what, Luther? You have twisted every word I've said.
130	484	And the next thing I know, my homecoming shoes are in the toilet.
163	397	Actually, he's more than a friend.
117	173	Look, I know what Kevin's doing is probably not healthy, but that's where he is right now.
122	377	I have an aunt like that, and she doesn't have any kids, either.
145	431	He's picking up whatever those guys are talking about.
127	588	All right, look, Rebecca, you're... you're... you're talking to a recovering drug addict.
118	370	Rebecca, you know what? You got what you wanted.
147	522	you will take over for commander sticky fingers here, and my boss will shower you with cash.
117	375	It's like watching paint dry, waiting for this geological report. Here's the thing...
146	306	You're trying to cut out the middleman. Don't look a gift horse in the teeth.
131	94	Okay. I'm gonna be playing myself. Ready?
128	215	Left, left, left. Oh, get him right there.
123	58	Where's Justin? - Taking a bath.
126	405	No. But what if he has one in every city? Don't you think I should tell mom?
118	520	Sarah, it's just a few more days drilling.
113	1092	He found nothing?  - Mm-mm.
164	548	When the time comes that the people of Earth discover life in the cosmos...
124	100	Mom, didn't you hear u we've been screaming into the monitor.
147	529	Now... Somebody get me a whiskey.
142	493	Sounds like you've got something good, Mike.
115	264	You want to know why? She is inches away from the truth about you two and Lena.
164	236	The environment on AG-143 is hot, arid...
126	29	I don't recognize her. She's been so obstinate lately, downright obnoxious.
112	58	Then they wait for just the right moment to pounce on their prey.
129	350	I guess there are some moms who don't believe their children are worth making whatever sacrifices are necessary.
112	512	These waters are an all-you-can-eat pile-up-the-plate
117	761	No, no, no, you can, you can. You have to have a blood test, and then you have to have another one, just to be sure. Another one.
112	444	Now struggle, struggle. You like that? Ah, it hurts!
114	309	Yeah, go haunt a Kix concert, perv.
115	373	Oh, becca, give it a rest.
145	415	It's time to leave that bloody dreadful marriage of yours.
140	448	He thinks I'm under fbi investigation.
137	831	We've been tracking your turkish heroin connection for terrorists!
163	339	Can you tell me who did? - How the hell should I know?
140	358	Well, it's a risk, but if you run, you'll be running for the rest of your life.
154	461	Looks like something's on fire in there.
120	132	You know, I-I really wish you'd fill Kitty in on your secret little run for governor.
114	331	There are things you don't understand, things we all can't understand, you hear me?
153	222	And someone who lied to help him escape a murder scene.
119	221	Hello? -- Hi, uh, Rebecca, it's Kevin... Walker.
141	298	No, no, no. I'm straight. That last eight balldid me just fine.
116	158	Sarah, please, please, would you go over there and talk to her?
113	1427	Well, then claim it. Claim it and come with me, be with me.
132	569	You made me realize that the real problem isn't that I'm not ready.
149	369	Nice. You could walk right over these and not even know they're there.
146	476	Yeah, yeah, you're telling me. - okay, we need a plan.
122	305	And as for my brother, Luther.
161	133	Come on, guys, hit the showers!
150	527	I just saw Rebecca leave in the escape car.
113	1393	She's our Lena. You listen to me.
124	45	You have every blanket in the house on him.
158	287	Look. l don't do this for just anybody, but...
153	116	Please go back to your rooms immediately and await further instructions.
158	559	We're not gonna go out there without Harry.[Tom] lt's not gonna happen.
112	174	All right, guys, now that I've added the fin, here's what it's going to kind of look like in the beast movie.
154	115	I want you to tell him that I intend to put his pathetic little enterprise out of its misery.
158	164	No way! That's it! That's it!
117	87	Look, they might even renew my visa. You never know.
145	79	I bet. The lease payments on that car must be scary.
130	103	Mom's right. I've gotta get my act together and get back to work. Yes, work.
116	66	Oh, could I have picked a worse time to be raising money?
155	146	Kind of giving me the heebie-jeebies.
145	593	I haven't been able to sleep well lately, and I've had a lot of things on my mind, but... I know we're going through some big changes -- you and I
125	300	Kitty, look, I'm gonna go in the houseand make you something cold to drink and maybe a tuna fish sandwich would be a good idea. hold up, hold up.
137	1121	You got a death wish, my friend.
129	476	What? - Ah, come on, Sarah.
119	128	Paige, you don't have to eat your duck, but please eat your rice and your potato.
142	587	And that I got to know Barry.
164	453	from the heat, gases, and minerals spewing from the vents.
164	462	The fact that life is found at all on Earth...
153	509	It's gonna be fine. Just say "yes" to every question I ask. You got it?
144	715	Maybe you and Vaughn have more in common than I thought.
142	91	Fail to complete a task, Nate dies.
112	3	A creature with incredible intelligence and strength.
131	375	I mean, between Karl's psychiatry talk, and Kevin's lawyer talk, and my mother and Scotty exchanging recipes, it's just, it's-it's- It's-it's snorefest.
144	198	So, Mike, how long you figure this is gonna take?
136	656	Those men who came to the house asking me questions
164	536	This field can be stretched out...
165	465	And since it is the only chance I'll get to show it to you.
130	321	Then just stop it. Okay? Just stop.
158	463	[Doug] So big![Danny] So many people.
144	20	It's a serious code book, is what it is.
158	655	Oh, no. You're not gettin' away with it that easy.
129	393	What's wrong? - Stop. No, I can't.
132	581	Braveand proud and fierce and crabby ...
130	219	With your business savvy and my experience in politics, we... we could really make this fly.
126	128	He's the one responsible for Kitty being well now.
121	436	with us. It's... it's... it's almost ready to start.
111	281	People in the quiet neighborhood were surprised to learn that this house had been a home to one of the largest drug rings Los Angeles has seen this year.
113	277	You may not think so later.
137	95	I could lose my clearance, my job, go to jail, even.
127	326	Oh, honey, I know you're serious, and normally I'd act all hurt and I'd scurry off to the hotel, and I'd wait for you to apologize tomorrow, but frankly, our schedule doesn't allow us such luxuries.
116	404	It's downstairs on the kitchen counter. - Want me to get it?
127	440	I wish you nothing but the best.  - Fine. Two weeks notice okay?
160	275	Says I'm livin' too much in '82.
130	467	Oh, okay. Okay. Well, good,'cause I am here...
112	8	The team must face their fears as they search for the source of the Kraken.
132	722	My husband - to - be ...
113	494	You know, I just hate hiding all the time.
147	44	He still doesn't know that some couples do things besides fight multinational conspiracies.
128	26	You are a Pasadenian, that's for sure.
128	273	And then I get to play with Kevrah.
112	37	These two, it's going to be virtually impossible.
126	194	What are you talking about? - It doesn't mean that I'm not happy with my three.
161	255	Got some money for some food? Hi.
124	559	And he chatted up everybody and...
118	676	All right. Well, I guess i'll see you guys back at the bat cave.
146	313	Hey, Mikey, we're in Carter's place now, planting his little undercover cop stash.
153	458	Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Fuller. I thought you were a field operative.
137	980	They're not that good. They're staring at a pay phone.
147	282	Well, my price for my ticket to the U. S. was lookout duty on a job in Belfast.
154	523	Schmidt just helped us get through that giant blender back there!
131	231	So you're gonna start him off on ours?
141	511	Yeah, yeah. I-I'm really sorry, man. I tried. I tried.
147	605	Were you and he, uh... Yes, we were, Michael.
146	124	I gave him everything I could, but it wasn't enough.
128	787	I don't know how to help you.
164	50	It gets enough heat energy from the star...
124	122	Well, yeah, he's an imbecile, but he has an assistant named yelena who has a sister named lauren who is dating Espinoza's legislative correspondent.
125	535	So you wouldn't have had a--a night without cancer there.
142	470	You give Brennen what he wants, chances are he'll kill you both.
150	76	The love of your life was lonely and abandoned in ireland, not sure if you were dead or alive.
131	680	Well, she's- In a story- She's old.
117	86	This is... This is suddenly a little too real.
150	122	Thank you for this. - Just don't let me down.
151	317	You can just take care of this one for me.
137	507	Mostly it's just hurry up and wait -- not too exciting.
130	254	And then when Dr. Taylor mentioned Walker landing,
119	602	I've made my appearance, I've met all the Joneses, and I've kept up with them.
154	444	Now you're in a hole covered in diethyl whatever-the-hell-it-is, ready to burn yourselves alive.
163	280	The man who kidnapped these girls has a relationship or a job that permitted them to get close enough to watch them.
149	432	So, they moved the fence. Now what? I'm gonna run the gauge along it, and when I get to the guns, I'm gonna need a distraction. Well, these guys seem pretty tense.
148	61	You really think you can get something off there?
125	365	Then let's go for a swim, everybody.
146	605	I kept thinking all my questions would be answered.
111	278	I look good on TV. Don't you think, Mike?
162	156	I've got you a ticket for the County Diving Championship.
142	362	"Forcing. "Such an ugly word. Encouraging? Incentivizing?
139	363	Cause, as you know, Ilco implements counter measures every year to stop people like me.
125	165	You know how excited she gets at political gatherings like this.
162	62	And that, lads, is how it's done.
115	742	Okay. You're gonna have to explain to Rebecca why I left before she got back with the ice cream.
159	293	Since when? - Two days ago.
113	221	This is one of the banned books.  - Yes, well...
147	130	You must be Fiona. I read your file.
114	464	Oh, hey, I got an interview at Suffolk County.
162	877	Look what your daddy's made for you!
124	290	Well, it looks like you're available to join us.
161	543	Are you smoking pot?  - No. I'm really confused.
123	179	It has been crooks, liars and hypocrites since the salem witch trials.
115	507	Do you have something on adamson?
115	875	A spokesperson announced earlier today. -you know, I-I.
163	479	Gill, are you even listening? It wasn't don.
153	304	She's a bit of a counterintel legend.
165	5	I'm just replacing parts before they wear out.
118	565	I've been watching you. What could be better?
156	703	You know what I think is the problem?
124	305	No wonder why you didn't have a life in high school.
164	284	Once the sargan finds a watering hole...
161	291	I get it. You made some bad choices, and who hasn't?
156	190	Maybe is not going to get her done.
131	576	Oh, no way. - Thank god.
152	144	No, you wouldn't. You'd need support.
112	422	Yeah, a lot more beak hidden in behind there.
164	457	In other words, if you look at all of the different kinds of environments...
140	143	It is everything I got, and you can have it.
155	290	No, we got to stay here.
159	472	How would we go about looking for her?
111	235	It was so awkward the other night,
131	671	And the reason that we love her is not because of all her accomplishments.
136	159	I don't remember this piece, but we do a lot of volume.
121	388	When I go to seat them, all of a sudden, they're no longer hungry. They wanna eat peanuts at the bar.
127	249	Yeah, he said you only have four weeks?  - Yeah.
117	22	you didn't put him in a wheelchair, Kevin.
137	964	A trail that the guys that killed Cowan can follow.
161	838	You know, Emmit, I can't believe I'm saying this...
119	327	Oh. Looks like Justin set up a little ambush here.
162	671	Brushing, flossing... occasional trip to the dentist.
134	273	You'd better watch out, because if they're after me, you can be damn sure they're after you.
135	328	Now, you and I, we --we both want the same thing -- for all of thisto just go away.
136	94	I got a letter about a month ago, uh, said I’d won a prize, one of those magazine things.
155	38	Would love to chat. a friend.
127	481	Where were you last night?  - Last night I checked,
120	633	Well, in his defense, he didn't know about it.
164	589	machines could actually become smarter than us...
161	35	Who can give me another name for gonorrhea?
158	202	National Poison Control Center. Ask for Lou. He's very good.
123	426	I came in top of my ass and won an internship here as apprentice sous chef.
130	685	Well, well, well, will you look at this? Uh-oh.
161	587	Thank you.  - All right, yeah.
113	53	You go running last night?  - Yeah.
118	225	You know, what if we all went together?
153	554	Bradley, do you have a shot?
113	690	And you know the law of the curse: no Caster may love a mortal.
134	250	Erik Luna, you are a hard man to find. You know that?
128	617	They're not gonna get any better if you keep butting in. - What?
129	27	God, you scared me to death.
131	272	I - I want you to know that I do care about your son.
120	444	Just tell Nora why she needs to build green.
151	45	Sam, you got someplace to be?
137	79	We build planes, satellites, weapons systems -- government contracts.
111	282	Mike, you're not supposed to be down here.
148	601	They're gonna shoot us! - Quiet!
129	473	How could you? - This is not what you think it is.
113	861	What curse was Ridley talking about?
126	437	Sterling. Kevin. Sterling Kevin. Good luck.
127	363	Remember Michael Mizlanski?  - Yeah.
113	681	Daddy's tie-pin. That is so sweet.
162	684	It'll make them silky and smooth, and... and add volume!
121	683	Oh, god. I hope that doesn't mean that they're both unconscious.
130	342	Look, let me... let me take you to a meeting. I'll drive.
150	429	It was filled with high explosives, over-pressured, armor-piercing rounds...
155	272	Is this is about the drink? 'cause water's fine.
112	378	We talked about scale on the ship, so we're going to apply that hopefully on this beach.
151	31	That may be the most evasive answer you have ever given me, and you can be pretty evasive.
164	374	These birds were meant to rule the skies.
161	848	Now maybe high school can be what you want it to be - instead of sucking rat nads.  - Oh, yeah.
126	751	And the two of you were quite serious with each other,
124	407	Maybe. Why? What's u mom said you fled the premises, and given your recent surgery,
124	568	But that night, when I got home, I sat in the girls' room for a long time and just watched them sleep, and.
131	639	Oh, bowling. We should go bowling.
116	219	And tell me, what is so threatening about admitting that there can in fact be a direct link between certain personality types and cancer?
158	171	Phillips will tell us tonight. ln the meantime, we have to focus on fine-tuning－
141	210	The people who are involved in this
123	535	You actually have no idea what it's like, do you,
161	486	Remember you said you had that real self-destructive pattern of always going out with guys that were just real losers, just dirtbags?
134	199	You're doing what's necessary for your family.
163	346	He stays here once a month, and he pays me $100 cash over the rate so I’ll look the other way.
137	561	They are two techniques that use opposite ends of the car and are disarmed differently.
155	1148	Looks like this party's about to get started.
146	381	I want to see those photos.
113	908	You good? Your kids are good?  - Oh, yeah.
115	222	It was very nice meeting you, Rebecca.
147	411	Maybe something's wrong. - Your clock is fast.
158	601	[Danny] Great to be here, everybody.[Rock]
113	1248	What do you wish for every year that you never get?
146	445	Your little fed friends are never going to see you again!
125	471	Uh, she wasn't there when I left.
125	256	Your attorney may be ableto pursue a claim against the personal assets of the funds managers, but--but that will take years.
126	156	No, Simon. We should talk. Please come in. We'll talk.
155	797	I don't do full-on procedures in my house.
132	290	Yeah, like the smithsonian, and - and since I'm there,I'veecided that I'm gonna take a couple of meetings.
161	416	Relax.  - All the shit's gone in your house.
122	717	Not bad. It's very risky to shoot from the hip le that.
125	337	I'll take good care of her. - Thank you.
149	249	He's not a trained operative. But Anson is teaching him some tricks
119	229	And -- and they all have names.
120	41	Nora, I thought you were gonna practically jump him right on top of the reclaimed wood sample.
114	58	Take a good look at the enemy, people.
134	587	I-I wanted to tell you, Quinn, but I couldn'T.
124	40	Who's Elizabeth? - She's my niece.
116	72	Okay, now I will be home in a couple of hours.
149	479	I guess it'll have to be. Okay. Thanks, brother.
130	505	Then why did you suggest it?
120	247	No. - I'll be on my cell phone.
140	137	If I get the records, I give them to Valentine,
162	303	There's a lot of homeless about these days.
153	374	Oh, sorry. I'll get rid of this.
125	519	What am I gonna do about the wedding?
155	1216	No, we have to deal with riley now, otherwise Bly just died for nothing.
155	1203	I thought you... -I was right there with her, man.
121	146	Who's Kimberly? - Kimberly's the waitress with the southern accent - and the gun collection. - Are you serious?
147	126	I know you don't like Armand, so it means a lot to me.
113	443	I don't think it's any of your business.
127	482	I didn't need to ask permission to leave the apartment.
125	129	Lu-lu-Luc is here? - Yes, he's outside.
141	332	It's not the smart play here.
142	325	But steal someone's credit-card number, and half the time, they thank you.
119	445	I haven'seen you at any of the H.R.C. Meetings lately...
141	100	So, who doesn't want her to have his money?
117	144	What happened to the $2 million I gave you to invest back in the company last month? You did?
165	193	Yes, powered from a wind pump on the roof.
125	367	No we don't need trunks. It's dark, and there are no children around.
126	63	Not that we know what it is. We-- we don't.
158	435	Ta-da! Last one in stock, and just my size. Lucky, huh?
129	513	Uh, hi. Yes, this one's for Nora walker.
138	280	I'm Michael. I used to work in covert ops. This is fiona.
159	426	Maybe it's some sort of test.
161	853	Luckily, they have a work release program, and they say I should be able to land a job, which excites me a great deal.
164	412	and they begin growing all over again.
140	305	But in my line of work you got to move with the economy.
156	335	That doesn't mean the network can't be hacked.
160	170	Do you think anybody wants a roundhouse kick to the face...
131	548	Well, you did it, Karl did it, so - Well, yes, Karl, but he's...
131	665	God. Okay, okay. alright. Hit me.
123	419	Uh, are...are we allowed to be in here?
111	518	I didn't realize you were the police.
123	210	Did he? Do you have the notice to appear?
141	274	How much longer before Drew gets back?
114	288	No. What? No. I had a frog in my throat.
148	222	or try to call the police...
113	541	Macon, no danger better come to that boy because of your kind.
144	306	I got a source in the bureau.
131	512	You'll be right behind us, okay? - I want to come with him.
158	290	How about you toss the lightning rod and get in?
163	102	Polly accepted an athletic scholarship to Penn state.
140	731	Looks right into a yoga studio.
151	520	I know what it feels like to wonder if there is a way out.
114	120	Why is Axl Rose standing in my bathtub?
154	544	Trading the location of fugitives can be worth a lot.
116	138	You're gonna get drunk, have a hangover, and regret the whole thing.
160	237	No. I'm freakin' starved. I didn't get to eat anything today.
161	389	They'll find out I'm not a real teacher.
122	266	No, no, no, I'm sorry, but I draw the line  at the first brothers doing the gay fandango in the lincoln bedroom.
148	39	Look, I'm just saying, Mike, the guy killed an experienced CIA field officer and framed you for it.
124	478	Of course it is. - Right. Why didn't we think of that?
132	491	Scotty, she is 9 years old.
124	712	Good,'cause I'd have no idea what to do.
147	406	There's no turning back now. We have to get Armand that truck.
116	38	Well, what are we supposed to do? We've come this far. I don't want to give up just
114	494	I don't want you to live at Danny's.
137	211	The sign is something innocuous, but hard to miss.
116	93	You were up all night? I didn't know that.
161	39	ln the male, the bacteria of gonorrhea usually enters by way of the urethra.
129	188	Don't do this. Luc loves you.
127	347	I don't even know why I told you.  - L... listen, Kitty. We need you to help us figure out what she should do.
131	176	Kitty Walker Mccallister and son of dean in sex scandal.
133	95	He says someone I crossed paths with in the ukraine is in town, looking to settle an old score.
130	109	My mom's a hotshot career woman with her finger on the "hold" button, and I'm just... I'm stuck in neutral.
124	53	And I'll get him something to drink because I have to get his pills anyway.
120	467	I just couldn't talk to that green mussolini any longer.
132	256	But it helps to get a little stretchg in before.
115	632	Where is everyone? This is ridiculous.
137	908	Buy a can of screen duster, turn it upside down, and you've got it in liquid form.
122	490	I don't care. Jason will ask me, and then I'll waltz all night with the president's brother.
112	499	And it's the sheer weight that it sinks it.
163	360	Yeah, well, 6 years ago, don called me from pittsburgh and he'd been arrested for soliciting an underage prostitute.
124	474	You know what? I,uh, I really appreciate what you guys are trying to do, but I'm not in the mood, okay?
160	165	No more flyin'solo. You need somebody watching your back at all times!
144	451	But the roads around here are flooded, Sam.
160	112	Because for a limited time only...
140	512	Don't worry your pretty little head.
121	239	Look, captain happy is finally remembering - what it's like to be single. - You named your penis captain happy?
119	242	Nora and Kitty! Oh, my god.
153	553	Target has retreated to second level.
161	15	Can I help you?  - No. With what?
119	408	It's on vibrate. Oh, excuse me.
113	1150	What part of "You cannot touch it if you are not a Caster" don't you understand?
126	218	No, I-I do. I do. I, I-I do. I believe you.
112	292	It makes no sense to me.
112	428	So it's got the serrated ring.
165	226	This was posted in the London gazette.
132	50	She has to transition into living with us.
126	123	They have already proven that this is not an accident.
164	121	it is going to be very dark and cold...
146	496	But spies know even a single weapon can be a serious distraction.
118	410	I just... Didn't sleep very well last night.
131	26	He's a kind of hazing the new guy.
154	462	Is that some sort of signal?
126	476	There is nothing about Simon that I don't already know.
129	11	Yeah. - You just did a spray tan?
151	193	Good afternoon, Officer. How you doing?
162	1310	We can't lose her. Not now.
144	70	What'd you find in that safe-deposit box?
146	223	And nothing's going to splash back.
125	364	I have to say, I've experienced the artist-chef, but the swimmer-danceris new to me.
132	4	It's hard for her to believe in happy endings.
136	151	Everybody's got a history with everyone else.
125	144	You were so brilliant at taking care of me, that I just--I just--I--I bounced back.
162	84	You got dodgy hair to match!
152	84	That explains why they took the case from the Agency.
129	540	All-all our lives, we-we grow by giving up things...
115	174	Yeah, well, what do you call it when you're, uh, sleeping with your brother's mistress?
158	566	What the hell is this? [Together] Shh!
136	433	They were gonna rip me off and go to the caymans or the seychelles.
126	372	Are we really out of lemons?
119	109	Great to see you. -- Good to see you.
131	207	Tell her this is completely ridiculous.
123	241	Jules, what do you say tomorrow you and Lizzie and i have an adventure?
131	76	I have to go. I will see you later tonight.
145	514	Well, are you sure, Mike? I mean, she's not you.
145	27	Sir, you have a phone call back at the office from Langley.
131	463	Well, Seth, you can come over anytime.
127	678	Well, Dustin Hoffman is madly in love with this girl, Elaine, but she's about to marry the wrong guy.
126	212	But as it turned out, the president of the bank was also on to him, so when I got to Guatemala city,
111	413	Parolee, history of heroin use, uh, possession, dealing, armed robbery, bunch of really nasty stuff, and I'm saying,
158	85	No. That was a joke. l'm not gonna eat your scraps.
117	288	Yeah. No, I - I understand completely.
124	438	I'm being Kitty, and I have to come up with some very funny personal anecdotes, you know, in case, um, whoopi wants to ask me a question.
134	204	Michael and sam checked out Erik and his brother.
131	545	No, I - well, no, no, he hasn't been published.
131	664	Would you just sit down, please?
165	273	Ah, so you have a rod and line?
128	599	You think he got the idea to turn that into a gun all by himself?
146	256	You destroy my bikes, I can't get you your money. That was last week's excuse.
123	23	Oh, don't give me that gentle Kevin look. You know it creeps me out.
112	96	It wobbles but you can just feel it's like...
111	250	It's about you and... and this baby.
127	528	What? What? What?  - Stop right there, miss. Code 9. Firearm.
128	673	Maybe that's my purpose, encouraging you.
125	224	What about that? let me show you. - No, I Luc, you know, he barely will dance with me.
127	63	Do you know where I have to go tomorrow?  - No.
137	71	Mike, buddy, you call me if you need anything.
115	445	Mom said it won't toast at the bottom if you stir it.
152	405	Stuff them in a rolled- up rubber floor mat, and you've created a vent  that will focus the flames into one area.
154	682	He just wanted to go so badly.
124	423	But before I tell you where we are, do you know that new pharmacy on colorado?
115	36	You want me to tell, uh, Kitty?
130	598	You've always been shiny, and... you know, you were homecoming queen.
127	78	I mean, Robert's not the only one who's losing his b.f.f.
124	349	Oh, really? Well, you should see him in there, fawning all over Roger.
117	376	I just got a thank-you call from Ardilla and company.
145	374	Snap your head to the side when you feel the impact.
160	408	Has Summer said anything to you yet?
126	133	Forget how much Ryan cost this company or anyone else,
124	585	Daddy... Sarah was so mean. They were all so mean.
130	5	We can make headway against the current if we try.
156	621	May I go back to my work now?
122	120	we have four live radio things. - Things?
120	311	Well, then I can't help you.
127	614	I mean, it's like standard operating procedure - for the rest of us.  - You're not mad?
160	354	Geez, sometimes up to three, four hours maybe.
134	568	I'm all for a gunfight, Michael, but this could be suicide.
127	53	She's got us running around town like the election is... is next Tuesday.
160	506	That's, like, a dollar an hour.
118	665	Okay, come on, Nora. Let's go.
122	230	That doesn't change the fact that he's still the evil spawn of satan.
153	357	I-I wasn't able to hear him very well because there was a lot of static and noise.
128	453	I was Venus to Sarah's Serena.
122	571	Uh, medium-rare is fin uncle saul. Thank you.
154	122	Sam, I think it's time to go.
156	381	She never would have sold it.
136	432	They got a goddamn bottle of champagne.
142	125	My life coach has strongly suggested that I try and avoid stressful situations.
155	1179	yeah. what can I do for you?
113	1118	It doesn't matter what causes it.
163	130	State championship football game. North mammon is finally back in it.
120	441	Uh, kyle, this is Roger grant, the architect.
132	313	I think this whole paige thing has been a real wake - up call.
153	82	There's a small amount of time when the authorities coordinate their efforts.
160	331	What are you drawing? - A liger.
117	477	I only came here to see what you clowns could possibly have to say.
147	554	Company policy, Vanderwall. - Then make an exception.
137	1017	All we know now is he's got Sam and he intends to kill us.
131	412	I don't know. I-I just... I felt so proud, being with you today at the book signing.
126	236	We'll see. We haven't started negotiating yet.
137	1063	He hangs out there, does a lot of businessin the V. I.P. Room.
111	39	I guess. What did she say about... about raising it?
123	109	Lina seems to be working out, huh? - Yeah.
141	134	I have to talk with Fiona about something.
145	558	Japanese cops took care of the rest of them in Kyoto, so they'll be spending a lot more time in a confined space than those girls did.
155	320	Which one of my guys did you get?
137	77	So, um, Pete says you're having some trouble.
137	591	Why don't you go make your arrangements?
112	540	So it's over and out from New Zealand.
146	62	One of the toughest parts of adjusting to civilian life after a major operation is the paranoia.
160	549	Don't disturb me while I'm in there.
154	234	He's -- he's a bad guy.
154	124	You made it sound a lot easier on the way in.
117	652	Thank you for being brave enough to talk to me tonight.
122	221	You can ask her about it. - That would be so awesome.
120	174	But you were just exploring-- same thing Paige is doing right now.
122	27	It's just that ever since - Kitty, Justin's plane left ramstein an hour ago.
137	89	Her husband, Kent, is abusive, controlling.
155	24	We're getting Sam back. Whatever it takes.
164	499	It's a world very similar to the moon Europa that circles around Jupiter.
123	433	It was the end of my first month here, and I was really happy because...
136	375	Now, are you seriously taking fiona to your mom's?
132	705	I know, honey, but remember what we say?
122	61	Well, I don't know what I'm being so smug about.
153	529	He's hiding in the second structure from the back.
151	298	These jackasses don't realize your career is at stake!
126	221	Well, I, you know, I have to be honest, I've been confused.
145	372	I'm not gonna hit you, Mom.
130	514	This is not my problem. I can't fix it.
128	697	I wonder if he's upset that he's not the man of the house anymore.
161	292	It's just you were starting to rant a little bit.
146	141	Mike, I thought we just talked about you taking some time off.
164	555	we notice three extremely large craters on the surface.
116	272	Why didn't I try to save the whales instead?
156	221	I can't owe my freedom to you, Michael.
153	533	We need to take Westen before his backup gets here.
118	251	And when I figure out what I want to do with it, I'll let you know, but if something happens to me,
145	538	It's a block over. There are three guards. The password is "nihonto".
130	14	Uh, I just want you to meet the photographer.
160	245	What are you doing here, Uncle Rico?
132	347	Look, Justin, i,uh, I totally get that you felt you had to do something, but the med board, they're gonna argue that when you're that close to the hospital, the decision to decompress a tension pneumothorax was premature.
130	377	You feel guilty for your children's failures because you no longer have what you consider to be ample time to help them.
163	579	They were starving, they had no food, nothing to eat except for their friends o had died.
137	954	Covert intelligence agencies don't call you up and tell you why they're hunting you!
129	310	Today we have a special show for you "dear mom: homespun advice for better living.
119	90	Nora, Saul, how are you? -- Good.
128	804	Is it the house? - No, no, it's...
136	662	You've been a busy boy, Michael.
154	603	Yeah, well, leaving a man behind should never be an option.
130	159	I also know you spoke with mom and Kitty. - Kevin...
115	292	Well, first of all, I didn't take credit for it.
127	243	Sorry I'm late.  - Remember Ginny, from the gallery?
154	666	You -- you saved my life, and I'm thankful.
158	211	Your key? You checked the doormat? [Chuckle]
147	142	There's a reason that everyone from 17th-century pirates to present-day drug smugglers have operated in the Caribbean.
112	188	No one's ever studied one alive.
140	680	So your boy Eddie took a ride with Valentine on his yacht.
116	701	I don't even care that he had an affair.
118	409	Scotty, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to jump on you.
147	96	Got in on the red-eye from Cairo this morning. My clock's still catching up.
153	326	You made the right decision, Mr. Axe.
156	638	I don't know, but I know I'm not leaving him behind, and I know this can't fail.
115	883	My wife and I did what we believed was best for our family, including our son aaron.
129	48	Then why are you here at 7: 30 in the morning?
158	279	l didn't even think to－ to look.
162	223	Have you got a little baby brother or a sister in here?
156	700	The risk of using a cover with a skill set you don't have is that at some point someone may demand results.
155	37	It's much harder when you find yourself sneaking out on the ones you love the most to attend a secret meeting in the dead of night.
132	19	And, uh, thousands of movie channels.
140	588	I sent guys but then his girlfriend showed up or something.
125	448	Oh, my god. You can't do it.
113	622	Excuse me for my untimely intervention.
129	156	Oh, where are my manners? You must be Nora walker.
135	507	That guy, bennett tash, openedbank accounts in overtown.
132	395	No, we're not your parents yet.
159	326	Their loss, my gain. Hey, how's that Karasz thing coming?
156	177	Barry, none of this is going to blow back on you, man.
114	208	Neighbours appreciated it. One of these.
134	67	Any questionable contact has to be reported to superiors –
117	416	God, no. Lawyers aren't great with nicknames.
152	382	There's always a risk when using a stolen car in an operation, but there are ways to minimize that risk.
144	151	Harris and I were prepping his testimony with him.
158	59	No, he's not. lt's a cardiac reflex thing.
161	316	These kids, they kind of look at me like I'm a hero, and, I don't know, let's run with that for a little bit.
149	279	No. I've been here for hours. Nobody's come in or out. The far-right window is covered, though.
139	29	Yeah, Carla's not the type to collect her own mail.
134	643	He -- he just winked! - Inside!
150	98	If that's where Anson keeps the t4 he used to frame Fiona
155	430	He sent agents to their death.
136	641	I’m glad it could work out.
163	622	Marcus, I'm not going to ask you again.
124	599	He's coming in on Tuesday to discuss.
128	534	Well, now, now. You should wait until you see my short game before you say that.
120	532	Seriously? - Unless you want to convince me not to.
139	224	I'm on the roof across from Carla's building, Sam.
130	694	It is me talking after all, so let's go get...
122	74	Oh, finally! - Oh, thank god!
158	645	No. God, l'm lucky to have met you.
120	585	Look, Rebecca, I,uh, I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.
119	190	Thanks, Saul. -- Thank you, Saul.
126	138	You want me to let Ryan off the hook just like you wanted me to let Tommy off the hook.
125	363	Sant? Thank you. Sant? Sant? Cheers
153	195	For the record, 4 minutes and 36 seconds.
130	415	No. Um, yeah, it was... it was me.
141	538	He thinks we're brothers in arms or something.
117	539	quaternary sedimentary rock." There's some of that there.
124	540	Don't talk to me like our mother.
119	18	These are all the senator's college friends and roommates.
157	711	$1, 350, and all Sam got on Carlawas a P. O.Box.
124	484	Saul said you talked to Sarah?
136	541	I need you and fiona to deal with bonnie and greg.
120	508	It's like our 8-month, 4-day, 2-hour anniversary.
155	1344	You're riding in helicopters, ordering around CIA officers.
114	333	That's the only resolution you are ever gonna get here.
156	665	See, here's the situation, Mr. Ward.
137	989	Hey, what are you doing? Hey, hey! - I'm sorry about that.
161	432	I'm trying to help you guys! Look at me!
130	452	I was so exhausted from trying to solve your problems, and somebody came up to me and offered...
124	244	Oh, yeah. Now-- now that's a good idea.
112	138	WE ESTIMATED THAT THE ANIMAL WAS 32 OR 35 FEET LONG
144	57	Didn't you guys hear? There's a hurricane coming.
120	419	You're bad at it. - Excuse me?
130	569	It's... it's all the stuff you were wearing right before the accident.
129	639	Well, I’m sure they've called in at one time or another.
117	286	So if we're approved, when could I expect the funds to come through?
148	87	You can start by letting me have your files on the investigation.
144	30	Simon probably knows who they are.
116	754	It's-- it's great. - It's beautiful.
147	382	I'm under orders from commander Jackson not to show them to anyone until I launch the operation.
164	554	As we approach the theoretical planet Gaia' Leo, our final stop...
137	1191	I'm gonna have to put your body somewhere, right?
119	3	Don't begrudge me being hungry for a little bit of adult company.
146	406	I’ll double your fee. You let me know if anything else comes over the wire.
122	590	Cooper, Cooper, Cooper. Justin's leg is hurt, and we have to not touch it, okay?
132	635	When you were anchoring, I never missed a broadcast.
146	172	A certain kind of target needs to feel superior, so if getting the job done means letting them be the dominant force in the room...
137	18	Whoa, Mike. Easy. That'll kill you, you know?
153	321	I want your word that Mike gets a fair shake.
145	38	He's a brit, he's a genius, and he's a very valuable asset of ours.
125	577	And she has to do all the tests... Drugs, mental, physical--everything.
126	570	Because, Paige, this really isn't your mom's fault.
127	384	I'll be there. I'll be there as soon as I get my car.- What's for now?
127	274	Right. We talked about that. I have to be there for a while, and I think it might look a little suspicious...Luc getting married a couple days before his visa runs out.
137	409	Yeah, about that -- how much are you paying meon this job?
124	652	Yeah, but this is as if I-I don't exist.
155	1287	Attention, motor vesselzazu, stop your engines immediately or we will be forced to use destructive fire.
120	222	Is that a yes? - That is a yes.
146	388	Somebody to keep an eye out for any trouble coming my way.
165	110	It's just one less rock for Susannah to lean on, that sort.
150	290	Well, we're not gonna let him figure it out. We're taking you and all this to the police.
129	404	Can I beg to differ? Because I - No! No, Jack, you can't.
118	658	Well, tell them to stop it. Boys, turn it off.
155	1002	Hey, I'm interested to know -- what happens if your plan doesn't work?
152	453	All right. I want to talk this over with Dawn in someplace private.
113	771	And I told you never to cross this threshold again.
153	144	Mike, you all right? Where's Sam?
154	411	Mike, we got to jam the fan with something that won't get cut to bits.
125	413	Okay, Ms. Walker, may I have the honor of the next dance?
115	465	Kevin, I'm sorry. I was just trying to feel your pain.
124	199	No, no, no, no. - don't lift his arm up like that, Scotty.
164	234	And pockets of this liquid H2O...
144	263	If he comes back, give me a heads-up.
112	421	There's a lot more beak. Oh, that's pretty sharp.
165	412	I have told him he will see his family soon, so he will no longer have to keep the locks of their hair to remember them by.
164	318	And the pholis' method of movement...
155	849	Well, we stopped the bleeding and closed him up.
122	125	Travis, I now have 9 minutes and 55 seconds left for lunch. Where is it?
137	430	You were gone for a long time, Michael, and you were the one who left us.
152	697	I'm sorry I couldn't be more help with this.
132	92	Okay, then you're gonna miss your first class.
153	97	It won't work, Michael. They're stopping every car that comes out.
119	61	Kitty, our lives are complicated enough.
162	1636	I told you, at the first.
141	697	Damn, Mike --the badge, the rifle.
148	448	Okay, so, how about this --you help us with our computer problem,
154	83	Yeah, I get that. But why isn't Schmidt here helping us out?
129	417	I’m-I’m... I’m sorry, but I really do need to go home.
134	373	Erik went after your mother because he's scared.
153	109	If I can take out the guard - Okay, whoa.
154	359	Not really. I can't say I'm a big fan of sending a guy out to be murdered.
117	435	Now we know why Justin's here.
160	406	Is there some kind of vest that I can wear?
158	96	[Screaming] My eye! Oh, my God!
118	612	I spent most of my life living in shame, Nora.
118	381	I'm probably wasting your time as well as mine.
115	246	Uh, not that I don't love thumbing through gay porn.
145	407	I could have driven us both back.
122	418	Now you're just telling me to make yourself feel better, which is the worst kind of selfishness.
115	160	They're acting all weird with each other, and now she's got this big dinner this saturday, and she wants us all there.
137	922	Sam leda hostage-rescue operation in venezuela for some U.S.Businessmen.
163	331	You smoke more than 100's, Mr. Haas?
155	946	The fact that she's using them is the best weapon we have.
148	125	It's just something to keep your mind off things while Sam and Fi deal with your CIA problem.
136	358	So you and Paco --You were cell mates, what, a year?
144	675	S. W. A. T. Teams call hallways and alleys "fatal funnels".
124	382	Absolutely not. - What happened at the luau?
124	177	I know. Look, come here. Let's enjoy this.
140	447	So, he's  not  gonna move the money now?
129	88	Uh... That isn't exactly what I had in mind.
164	79	and taking what energy it can out of that and making food.
140	666	I don't even like the music anymore.
122	534	I can't believe you did this yourselves. - Daddy even got some balloons.
115	27	How is it being back on the campaign trail full-time?
128	303	Why did he go back, Justin?
161	802	No, it's okay. I'm blocking the pain.
124	476	where are you going? - I'm going home, Kevin.
141	517	I tried to tell him the job was off.
156	453	And you don't want to see him in withdrawal.
154	268	Hey, Mike. You get our tickets out of town?
119	107	She's not so bad. -- Nora?
117	328	Uh, Sarah, do you think Luc can join us tonight?
120	180	My god, I can't even put on something sleeveless without thinking twice.
117	348	Well, because I don't know what it is yet. I-I swear.
153	336	Then you tell me what will!
138	255	No, it's not. We have till friday.
131	38	Of course, change is difficult, but keep up the good work.
126	626	I mean, York had years to make his move.
124	225	I thought you didn't want a shower. - I didn’t. Now I do.
147	407	Like it or not, Sam, this heist is happening.
152	50	When he's not in an environment that reinforces his authority, you're a lot more likely to get something out of him...
125	385	I heard mom talking on the phone, and she said aunt Kitty's really sick.
152	563	Jimmy, are you sure Robbie here ain't playing us?
148	268	I do, but I'm gonna need your help.
118	354	So, Justin, I've been thinking a lot about the whole haiti thing.
117	414	Well, look, if you were in legal circles, I was known as "the greaser".
118	350	And, uh, I will, uh, get back to you.
136	131	I'll just tell them that I’m babysitting you.
150	326	You want me to betray my own team? - don't be so dramatic.
136	158	I do work like that, yeah.
148	615	When I'm clear, I need you to shoot at the crates and then hide in the back with the other hostages and have everyone take cover.
145	202	That's why, um... I called in someone else to play nurse.
121	553	No. No, no. I was hoping that Leonard Bernstein would give me the courage... to kiss you.
116	484	Um, Robert's meltdown was caught on camera, and now it's upload to youtE.
120	275	You did say yes to everything, and unfortunately, most eco-sustainable materials are slightly pricier.
125	709	Okay, Dr. Cooper, what's your wish gonna be?
131	110	I'm, I'm sorry it didn't work out, Vinny. Good-bye.
131	410	I know. I... Look, I want you to feel a part of my family.
131	311	We have a call over by the country club.
114	306	I don't usually get complaints, especially not from the ones looking for it.
159	367	Tonight, at the reception, he reminded me that he still blames me for the Vaci deal...
145	81	I don't know who else to talk to about it.
146	352	Thought you and Vegas were hunting this down together. Where is he?
147	329	Miles Vanderwall! I need to speak to -- you're looking for Vanderwall? You found him.
126	680	Paige, you are such a smart and capable and mature young lady.
130	64	Well, he called me, Kevin. He just wanted to make sure that you had enough blankets.
116	202	Um, flaxseed oil, herbs, vitamins. - Oh, my god.
141	457	I already tried! It didn't go through! - So?
116	654	What if my son never knew how I felt about guys like Henderson?
145	239	You think you can threaten me?
130	483	Oh, right, just like in high school, when I accidentally ripped your jelly shoes, and you walked around for a week saying,"I'm fine. I'm fine.
115	399	He's been in a private treatment facility since birth and adamson has never publicly recognized him.
130	260	You know, I-I'm late for work. I'm already two days behind on this commercial.
125	352	I mean, I might be a little busy walking Rebecca down the aisle.
150	466	At the end of this, you'll look like the only operative who wasn't on the take.
111	164	Well, we would love to be as involved as, as you would let us.
139	328	Look a little jumpy, Trevor, you're not nervous, are you?
125	390	She has a disease, an illness, called lymphoma.
147	586	When I say "Hot water," I mean the poor guy's been dismembered.
132	10	In theory, but I think that we should choose a date today.
119	248	She's following in our footsteps, Nora -- five children.
140	288	You might only have a few seconds,
118	461	Oh, great. He's a little jittery.
162	1800	The sweetest nectar. Food of the Gods.
151	408	Looks like we found a ride.
146	542	The judge just signed a search warrant for this place.
160	357	Does that cost money every time you're on, like for minutes on the phone?
124	481	You're--you're not gonna let me leave, Sarah?
162	983	He doesn't like being so high up, sir.
158	477	Right. Right. Someone could fall down in this. l'm gonna shut it.
137	100	They're from a subsidiary of sxg in turkey.
144	293	A friend at the phone company put me on his line.
121	598	It's up to you whether or not you want the mother you got.
117	696	I think that we should just go home. No, we should go.
129	273	Are you kidding me? You're Nora Walker.
154	564	On your feet! - What? What? Oh, God!
144	517	Look, I'm just doing this long enough so I can get myself a boat and float away to some island where no one knows who I am.
111	149	I like your shirt. Are you a Vampire Weekend fan?
162	186	You ask a lot of questions, don't you?
148	400	Agent Loman, FBI. We absolutely have a problem.
140	353	For an emergency meeting in 10 minutes, and he is pissed.
164	419	that look like animals and animals that look like plants
129	155	It's just with running the charity, and shopping for my grandbaby's birthday, and the book tour, I’m simply swamped.
130	202	Everything you felt then, everything you feel now.
155	439	You think I'd turn on him for no reason?!
128	373	It's gonna be a long day. Let's go, Kev.
111	260	No, I mean, she must think I'm, like, some kind of stalker.
159	276	How bad is it? - I'll be fine.
162	1101	Drawing makes you look at the world more closely.
140	37	Sometimes when you meet a new operative, it's a good idea to open with an aggressive move.
137	1029	You got some death wish or something?
112	310	Maybe the Kraken thinks this boat is a whale.
131	558	I know sometimes you have to shout to be heard around here.
150	30	We can't let him do this. - I’m gonna confront him with it today.
164	520	blinding whatever creature came up to it.
122	414	I talked to Justin about it, and-- and I wanted to tell you.
152	542	Good. Get her on the phone, Jimmy.
155	900	Modern night-vision goggles provide visibility in near total darkness, adapt to changing light conditions, and provide better contrast and resolution than the human eye, which is why most assassins aren't just confident in the dark, they prefer it.
162	1561	Don't be stupid. I haven't taken your beers.
144	548	Free mojito for anyone who can tell me if the Venetian Causeway's
131	480	They must feel like they're being sold, like puppies in a window.
137	770	He said the peoplehe works for -- they have plans for me.
140	301	They don't make them like that in beantown.
134	376	before my dad died, he made me promise that I would protect my mother, and I'm not gonna let him down.
151	104	The sisters can get their hands on pretty much anything.
134	675	Looks like you won't be needing this.
126	596	No, my project fell apart. Yours didn't.
145	273	Tell me -- are you sure you're not lost, English lass like yourself?
126	752	For a brief time not too long ago.
128	620	Look, I don't know, but he already has a father, who, by the way, is not exactly thrilled about you, and obviously, neither is Cooper.
112	276	Battling storms, swells, fearing death by tentacle.
128	366	No, but that's probably 'cause I still have my job as a united states senator.
155	471	You want me to believe that you just called up the Atlanta p. d. and they gave you the file 'cause what?
151	335	You trying to make me shoot you?
142	563	Of course you will, Brennen. She's your family.
128	517	Look, she's, like, the child whisperer, okay? Let her focus on Cooper.
133	387	Military units  are a lot like marching bands.
118	359	Rebecca, like, w - we just got married.
163	442	No one will ever know what happened to us, we'll starve to death and no one will ever know.
141	366	You don't think Roth would ever get arrested for selling cocaine?
145	13	When you're pursuing someone, it's tempting to focus exclusively on overtaking the other person.
115	422	Well, you know, trying to be the perfect family for some republican operative my mom has the hots for is making me a little nervous.
113	1231	And whatever happens, happens.  - Hey.
116	141	As much as I'd like to say it's a bad move, right now, it's our only move.
130	430	No. No, no, no. It's... Justin, it's no biggie.
128	137	They will come after her hard.
147	502	We know you sent Cahill to torch the uplink so that you could sneak onto the island and steal our information.
146	444	Well, I suggest you get me in handcuffs before you start yammering on about putting me in a gas chamber!
131	447	the way we were," barbra streisand.
159	441	Don't do anything stupid and no one gets hurt!
129	76	You haven't lost all your cases.
126	424	Wait till you see the robot start dancing.
119	283	Oh, god, that was so -- do you remember? You were so funny.
114	529	Didn't think about her once I bit it.
114	518	Some things just need to stay separate.
132	664	And if I don't like living with you, I can't change my mind and come back here?
114	525	You know, before you, I was fine.
153	445	It looks to me like something was about to go down here.
121	634	Anyway, you're the one who's turned getting Lucky into an art form.
131	610	I made a, uh, terrible fool of myself last night at my girlfriend's house.
120	620	I understand you're gonna go with Coad because he's the dependable party guy, someone you can count on, but if I'm any kind of example, you can expect the same from Robert.
135	561	Actually, I think that, uh, something mightcalm me down a little.
142	114	Happy? Now, get in the damn car.
154	541	Did he also mention my little fail-safe?
147	442	Get used to the pain, mate.
164	504	But inside these oceans, they could be teeming with life.
120	211	That's weird. - It is weird.
142	501	But not kill the neighbors. - Really?
122	611	And-- and while you may or may not still want to be a part...
124	561	And then I met... Roger, and he talked to me all night.
162	936	well, he was old and he couldn't move easily.
127	622	Well... well, answer it.  - Well, I... I don't want to.
146	41	And since Charlie's been born, I’ve been trying to keep my nose clean.
124	254	Eh, I've fired you before. - True.
128	808	Cause you are the only thing that works in my life.
119	801	It's really -- it's no big deal.
150	103	Fine. - And, Mike, whatever job she's given you, be careful, will you? I don't want you getting shot just before we cross the finish line.
152	168	He volunteered for this mission because he wanted to do something worthwhile, something good, because that's who he was.
120	267	It's a lot like raisi children.
118	179	They stimulate the economy... - Oh, my god!
155	591	Then, as long as you can count to 10 and know the phone number you're dialing, you can complete a call to anyone.
155	1210	If we leave empty-handed, she gets a free pass on all of this.
148	102	All the more reason for me to stay busy and out of her way.
128	514	Sarah, she raised five of us.
160	422	Girls only want boyfriends who have great skills.
145	210	Listen... This guy can't know that you're working with us.
150	72	Or any one of the other acronyms you work for, Michael.
132	497	Wow, that was like you were just channeling nora.
153	312	Then he should just explain himself.
115	41	We got a fund-raiser downtown at the jonathan club.
155	245	You said Westen was headed toward the everglades.
123	56	I still love you. Okay? Bye-bye, chicken.
128	723	But we don't know that, do we?
145	280	Yes, married -- guilty as charged.
165	434	You said you knew Robin, but you didn't say how.
135	51	Now, I paid a hefty sum to learn that they'reselling the stuff on friday, but nobody knows the buyeror the location.
158	295	Oh, thank you. Laundry room's that way. Bathroom's right over there.
156	662	I'm sorry, Detective Tibbs, but I don't talk to cops.
126	426	That's what the disco balls are for.
130	665	Ex-in-laws. They... they actually dumped me yesterday.
113	244	Oh, I just came to see if you were okay.
131	266	I-I really am very sorry that you had to find out about Seth and me like this.
125	487	She asked me point-blank,"is aunt Kitty sick?
150	failed	Previously - you were there in the beginning. - It was a dazzling idea.
156	278	Cops got here earlier than we expected. We got to go.
154	513	Past that, we got to backtrack through the lake of fire.
163	167	When Brooke's father was gone, when the other parents were out.
158	517	She'll get over it. lf Jake's bad luck is half as bad as mine was...
150	124	Michael, this is nick carnahan on loan from the 1st special forces operational detachment-delta.
160	372	Let's go, Kipper. I think we should take this...
140	203	Most modern bomb squads are equipped with an r. f. jammer.
122	462	oh, great, at least the female population of pasadena will be safe for a while.
117	757	We light the candles. Light the candles.
163	81	Polly homefeldt and Kelly Seymour were sleeping over saturday night.
140	120	The thing is, the other day, Valentine calls me into his office, tells me there's $2 million missing from a charity account.
145	57	Refinished floors, marble countertops, great ocean views,
148	166	Are you Graham? - That's me.
152	492	Oh, my God. - I can't remember.
113	15	I've been stuck my whole life in Gatlin...
129	577	I’m sorry. - Okay, apology's accepted.
147	206	It may be tempting to shoot first and ask questions later, but if you want to stay alive, you ask questions first.
120	475	You know, Paige is growing up.
114	354	you want me to help you pass the time until you completely nut out?
145	335	If you help me, my friends will save you.
131	248	You were so playin' up the hero thing.
120	58	No, Arlo Natterson would've noticed because he's successful, and successful people notice every detail, and he's a 20-something partier, and I'm a divorced mother of 2 who doesn't Twitter and doesn't have a Facebook page.
137	398	Good, good. I don't need anyone sniffing around.
115	403	I know, I know, but I am not gonna use his kids.
161	412	Screw this, man! I'm out of here!  - Wait a second!
164	615	a theoretical structure known as a Dyson sphere...
155	953	He knows Tom Card was dirty and he has a thing about CIA officers breaking the rules.
125	39	Then feel the warmth as a healing white light rains down on your body.
149	153	Hey. I got your guidance chips. What happened to Arnie?
161	140	Hey, T-Dog. You've got to admit hiring Drillbit was a good idea.
111	89	Knock on all these doors here, see if anybody saw the shooter going in or out.
146	563	Still trying to sort out everything that happened back there, but if there's one thing I know for certain you saved my life.
136	9	...an old friend who's informing on you to the fbi...
135	177	Either aunt sandymade a miracle recovery or amy never left town.
144	459	Okay, Smoking Mama, is, um, Jesse there?
128	71	We had an incident at school… a small thing...
132	255	Up a hill and over a ravine, around a reservoir ...
130	358	I can't picture you picturing me.
130	60	I needed a recipe. - That is such...
113	713	like God, and love, and righteousness...
124	435	Can I talk to you for a second? - Sure.
148	65	We're not exactly on speaking terms.
126	522	God help us when they're teenagers, huh
160	283	She's, uh-- She's got sandy blonde hair.
129	370	What are you apologizing for, sweetheart?
129	339	Fabulous! Then. you, me, and a cabana at the hotel venegas have a date.
161	339	Yu-Gi-Oh-four-seven, you are not clear to cross.
127	519	We're in an awful hurry, and my daughter has to stop a... a wedding that's gonna happen in... in minutes here.
144	443	Find out anything you can on this girlfriend and where she lives and do it fast.
134	707	When the devil himself is offering the thing you want most, sometimes you dance with the devil.
156	272	Because your liver is chewing on 1/5 of Tequila and you've never seen someone beat a SCADA firewall.
123	131	I swear I could eat this child up.
158	607	One－ Help me out. One, two, three!
126	177	A radio? Why? - Do we have one or not?
120	23	This glass comes with a specialized glaze that blocks the sun's radiation.
130	367	And they're all yelling at me to butt out, and that's the thing with children...
113	679	That's what comes of pretending to be something you're not.
145	163	Either he's Japanese Mafia, or he's been keeping a pet tiger.
152	349	Mix too much sedative with alcohol and you shut down the part of the brain that controls the heart and lungs, which means your target won't be sleeping.
134	591	They're --they're right up the block.
140	646	That was beautiful. That was mine.
115	58	You want to save this campaign?
145	486	But I was able to give that son of a bitch a shot of morphine and lock him in the other room.
117	745	Justin, you know what? You know what? I have.
153	31	Just help me get the man who gave you that order.
120	177	And the thing is, Paige feels great.
158	606	McFly on three. On three. Champagne time.
116	558	Oh, here. I'll come with you.
130	516	We good to go? - No, Frank. The photo shoot is off.
119	697	I hope you don't feel bad about the game.
149	108	It's a chemical-research facility, closed two years ago.
161	877	Did you know abierto means "open"?
118	422	Whatever you do, don't go in the kitchen. Everybody's freaking out.
127	396	You know, it was a...  it was a tough week.
155	837	We're going to stay here as long as we need.
138	172	Victor denied the hits, but a guy named philip cowan burns him anyway.
162	690	Leave the shed, go to the tower, leave the tower, go back to the tower.
113	17	By the time we get a movie, it's already on DVD.
111	589	And turns out, she's having the-the...
125	588	But listen, if it's too much of a gesture, I could put you down right now.
119	138	I haven't seen them for years, not since the great game night debacle.
140	605	But you're still living like a rat in the shadows, - Not manning up to your business. - You shut your mouth!
155	1017	So, Mike, you sure you want to be here when this goes down?
134	235	You see that --see that wire?
144	547	Anyone who ever passed a note in class knows there can to sending messages in front of your enemies.
128	748	Nora, the first time you enlist, it can be about a bunch of things.
158	284	You know, l got a washer-dryer, uh...
149	473	Do you think you can convince him the delays aren't an accident
119	728	Yeah, yeah. You know, I mean
124	398	Hi, yeah. I just wanted to know if I have a refill left or whether or not I have to call my doctor.
155	963	How do we know she's going to go back to the cartel, Sam?
120	801	I think you'll find it more reasonable, although, no more, uh, dual flushing toilets.
127	701	This could be the hidden value of Ojai Foods, Nora.
122	537	Hey, um, all right, look, let's go hang these up, guys. Justin's gonna love 'em.
141	295	If he catches you and it gets back to Larry, the body count on this will go way up.
152	493	It doesn't matter. There was a bunch of them up here.
111	314	Yeah, I-I know where Stockholm is. Thanks.
132	149	If you're interested in talking to him, I mean, I could - yeah.
127	461	So this it?  - Now all we need to know is where it is.
132	43	Because I told you, one day, Olivia will need a desk.
154	679	Nate promised to take me away from Miami.
131	554	Well, as I said before, I think it's time for me to go.
158	267	Thanks for the ride, Jake. Yeah. Hold up one second.
116	439	And he gave her another try.
154	602	I didn't talk him into anything. It was the only option, and you know it.
113	1336	an old cycle shall end and a new cycle shall begin...
137	632	They were supposed to be here 20 minutes ago.
124	295	I'm going nowhere, dude. – Good you can give me a ride. Let's go.
146	468	Okay, okay, you can come along. Now get him in the car!
122	315	The Mccallister campaign thinks abe lincoln was gay.
113	1125	unless you stop feeling so sorry for yourself all the time!
112	309	I think this is a case of mistaken identity.
162	17	Mikey... you know the flat wasn't big enough for the three of us, especially with the baby.
123	583	Ok, um. I know you hate this question. But, I gonna ask it.
118	514	Look, Sarah, I can explain... - No, I will talk to her. Thank you.
128	267	Well, now's your chance to find out.
119	132	Oh, yeah. Right. Yeah, we'll sit here and eat huey and dewey with these two staring at us.
113	1004	You'll get the both of you killed. You have to get out of her life.
111	509	You keep this up and we're both going to end up in jail.
131	616	I think the question is, why were you so uncomfortable in the first place?
122	285	wait, wait. So when you and I were on the washing machine, you and paula had already...
164	477	perhaps stable for billions of years, containing liquid water.
146	402	Hundred bucks says you prick his finger, he's bleeding blue, okay?
149	131	And when your customer will settle any issues with a bullet to the head,  it's a good idea to show up in person. Brought the materials you ordered.
152	404	old newspapers and fast- food bags doused in hand sanitizer.
122	340	That's not the point. - Senator, we're taxiing.
119	690	Look, we got a 50-50 shot. Rebecca's got a feeling.
161	400	What am I gonna do with you guys?
148	183	We board his plane, we use our, uh, hardware to take care of his security detail and to convince Mr. Gronbach to give up his bank codes, and then you...
161	183	Wakisaka, 990 men. Ankokuji, 1,800 men.
161	584	Okay, I hope I speak for everyone here in saying that I feel this issue is resolved.
123	339	Oh, except I have to spend time with this putz.
136	31	You'd notice if the neighbor hasn't vacuumed his car, if the postman isn't wearing his wedding ring.
127	71	His term is winding down, and he's not as busy as he used to be, and he doesn't know what to do with himself.
145	171	Looks like Takeda got tipped off.
129	183	No, you guys are busy with kids and lives, and there are plenty of reasons.
164	137	they resemble jackals in the plains of Africa.
146	283	Hey. - Nate and I found Carter's apartment in coconut grove.
147	135	Oh, that's just how we're trained. It used to bug the hell out of my fiancé.
125	463	Luc, thank you for a wonderful meal.
165	265	That is how it should be.
123	219	That is not what he looked like, dad. - Oh, come on.
132	484	I mean, she made it clear, she did not want to be with us.
140	572	Under the right circumstances, a well-placed rock is as good as a bullet.
120	225	That was Ethan calling from the site.
134	291	If Erik's car blows up a weekbefore his custody hearing, they'll be a lot of eyes on april.
123	514	I know. I know. I know. - It hurts so bad.
154	574	You know damn well if the Feds grabbed Vanek, they would have tracked us all down.
122	465	Because I think you sent the entire world supply to iraq.
158	332	You give up? l give up. l don't care anymore.
141	90	Well, slippery slopes can be kind of fun -- like water slides.
144	69	I didn't want to bother you until I had a good reason.
123	286	And the breathalyzer machine is accurate enough to be used as evidence in a court of law in the state of California?
131	407	Look, if it all gets to be too much for you, we can just go off by ourselves and watch antiques roadshow - No, no, no.
150	504	You were working with Anson the whole time.
155	636	Intelligence-agency safe houses are designed to be difficult to detect.
126	481	Kevin, be careful. None of that fruit's glued to those boxes.
129	256	I I don't think I have the right shoes for a smackdown.
111	473	If I could just get a, uh, quick taste, I'd be a lot better.
160	365	I'm one of Pedro's best friends. - Your name is Napoleon?
129	524	I’m afraid that I’m never gonna get out of this fog that I’m in, and I’m afraid that I’m never gonna be able to be with another man.
126	709	That doesn't mean that we can't be.
132	412	No, no, no, no, no, no. No, that's not how thi is gonna go, paige.
128	254	Why not? - I've got Cooper for the weekend.
153	479	And any hope for a peaceful resolution flew out the window once your friends set us up for an ambush.
129	530	Listen, Catherine, you're grieving, not only for the husband you lost, but for the life you had envisioned.
120	605	Won't need it that long, but thanks anyway.
153	525	All right. Fine. The truth is, he's a two- bit, drug- dealing loser who used to be Mike's neighbor.
147	410	That gizmo Maddy placed in the bathroom should have gone off by now.
161	697	Remember the plan. Strike first and strike hard.
154	507	Son of a bitch. - Sam, what's wrong?
144	54	And stash that until Vaughn is gone.
163	158	I don't want anybody assuming that they're involved.
131	408	No, I don't want you to think that I'm obsessed with that show, it's just that I thought tonight...
146	169	Yeah, I have a business meeting.
155	490	Michael has principles about not hurting people.
111	302	Bro, where did you go? you had me freaked man.
125	680	Really? I'm just glad you still want my advice.
127	416	Oh, I updated your web page.
151	234	I would compensate you for your losses.
150	346	Talk to one of your black-market dealers. - Michael...
150	48	You think you can take that shot? -  You just let him know it's over and step aside.
114	469	Isn't that where you do your orderly thing or...
117	151	I can't believe this. I cannot believe that I gave you a solution to this problem, and you won't accept it. Rebecca, I know what I'm doing.
120	181	Well, this is not about your insecurity, mother.
117	531	Robert wants me to go down to his office.
145	437	Hey, if your firm wants to lend us any more of its fancy toys, no complaints here.
153	28	You'll have to wear a wire. We need Card's confession on tape.
113	149	You cut Emily like a surgeon.  - Years working with the bitch virus.
114	8	I would love to leave. I would love to just open that door and magically walk back into the life that was ripped away from me.
114	419	I've been dead 7 months and I'm going crazy!
162	1282	Perhaps he thought I was a figment.
120	608	This is a great party, and we have been working nonstop.
140	88	Ricky came by to see Michael,
152	693	the sale order shows where the gun was made, when it was shipped, and then it landed at the Pryon Group.
119	573	Sarah mentioned to me that you don't even have a guitar of your own to practice on.
164	71	you're going to find creatures that are adapted for both.
116	244	Nora, did you get the final head count for tonight?
113	379	I'll get my teaching degree, and probably teach at the high school.
161	651	Me and Emmit are gonna back you up.  - Oh, now it's me and Emmit.
155	1140	You promised me Riley in personal contact with the cartel.
128	298	Put it in the soup. It's an herb bouquet.
142	285	I was at the University of Michigan. I graduated 1. 9 gpa.
112	349	Man. I don't know if I can do this.
162	1231	I thought that shed was coming down.
156	685	Is raiding your office today, and the Chief is worried that you guys are going to destroy all the evidence the second we kick in the door, so we need you to go back to your office right now and plant this little ditty in your mainframe.
145	245	If you don't, you can watch them kill your whole family first.
145	229	Shape up, darlin', or he won't be the only one who needs some serious medical attention.
160	473	I'm gonna tell you somethin'. While you're playin' patty-cake with your friend Pedro...
147	88	You can say no. I'd understand.
130	530	as she put her little boy on... on the school bus.
161	50	That's mine. Seriously, stay out of it.
144	340	This is the best ropa vieja outside of Castro's
141	689	Well, she hasn't had me kill anyone yet.
113	580	This is where my family goes to celebrate what's holy:
123	460	What's too hard, Julia? What? What are you talkin' about?
161	318	You're really getting into this whole teacher thing here, huh?
137	1285	You give me 12 hours, you don't need to find out.
130	526	You're liable to get another rambling soliloquy.
151	257	Are you okay? You know Michael.
147	121	It's an in-and-out job in the Caribbean.
146	165	I picked up that paper shredder we didn't get a chance to buy the other day.
148	173	I got to know what the job is.
124	361	Why is there a trumpet in here?
145	73	So maybe you and I can meet again Monday?
111	328	Cover. That's why he shot him second.
119	81	The... the helicopter incident in Kuwait, does anybody else know?
156	533	Yeah, and you can start by telling us what the hell you did to Tricia.
155	156	Give me that. - let go of me!
118	798	All right, Kitty. Keep talking to him.
158	244	They sound good. Yeah. Yeah. They do, don't they?
139	248	I time-lapsed the footage here, just to see if there's any kind of a routine, but the maintenance man and the gardener don't really have one.
162	1053	I live just across those fields.
131	337	I'll give you two a minute to talk.
149	391	We heard you. What? You think we're crazy?! You think we want to get shot?! Come on! Please.
124	235	Well--well, not the--the topic, but the--the spirited
116	690	Okay. - We'll just-- we'll take this little piece right here...
146	358	You put me in the position to make plays, I score every time.
116	282	I don't have a helmet. What a shame.
162	345	That is a vile, unnatural brew, that is!
119	587	Those things are rock-hard. He could get a concussion.
113	1085	A Keeper, as in you're a...?
140	577	Eddie has a Ricky problem. We'll help him solve it.
140	135	What you need, Ricky, is a forensic accountant.
118	447	Cable news picked up the private jet story just as we were coming off the bus.
150	186	Unfortunately, when timing is that precise... - he's coming your way.
131	138	Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This is Kevin.
120	649	No, that wouldn't be fair to you, Ethan.
111	109	Vega, I'm attaching you to the federal task force.
150	472	I told you. I was - I was with my mother.
151	375	But if it gets here after 9: 00, you'll be spending another day dodging the sisters.
145	64	I think... I got to take this.
118	733	well, I'm glad you're okay, Saul... You big drama queen.
119	119	Mrs. Jones, I'll have your turkeys wrapped and ready to go in a minute.
126	248	But you have been waiting for this opportunity your whole life.
155	1342	It doesn't look like the same.
122	353	I can't tell you how much I need this job, but I-I just would feel really weird if you gave it to me because of nepotism.
162	85	At least I'm not a wuss!
121	78	The truth. It's not a good time for me. - You told her not to come?
116	602	Um, there have been so many exciting new treatments discovered over the past few years, but we can't forget this
119	799	You -- you want to tell me what happened?
129	638	They have better things to do than to sit around listening to the radio all day.
140	272	I do a perimeter check once an hour.
120	736	You got an investor? - Yeah.
124	509	Yeah, well, dad did your term papers for you.
115	702	Let's go back to the table. Come on.
119	510	Oh. Well, that's fine, Miranda, so long as you don't mind my family kicking your family's sorry ass into the middle of next week.
113	1100	It's as alive as you or me. Strongest of every spells, good and bad.
144	692	If I'd taken off for Jacksonville like those other who would have found the photograph that saved
124	475	And this hotel room is getting crowded, so I'm going
127	530	Is this your bag, ma'am?  - Oh, oh, oh. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
146	237	Throw in a police boat and a service issue glock planted at his place, - he might as well be wearing a badge. Right. - Right. I love this idea.
137	27	Pete, one of my buddies from the seal teams.
111	303	Is that part of the game? Yeah, it's a message from another player.
137	164	Don't leave the house. You can do that, right?
137	168	And i'll need to get some, you know, supplies in case things get dicey around here.
162	83	And I got a dodgy ear.
140	185	Ricky's getting us the security codes,
123	86	You...you're definitely gonna have to talk to her. - Thank you. Finally.
122	54	This time, I want you to imagine your adorable reverend jason all sweaty in the jungles of madagcar...
147	550	Sorry. No guns on the chopper.
155	954	Well, he's not just going to take our word for it.
129	357	Well, uh, uh, yeah, it's, uh, Devon from l. a.
153	500	I don't even want to think about what's in this water.
161	436	Drillbit, just tell us the truth.
153	100	Ms. Riley, we have visual on all floors.
158	529	He's not here. [Man #2] We want McFly!
159	170	Don't be a bitch. He meant me.
132	152	Well, I just - I wanted to make sure you were all right.
150	28	Everything the cia didn't find - and he's got himself an instant recipe for mayhem.
153	496	And if we can't get back to Riley in time? If you're wrong?
122	100	I have a million things to do. - Oh, let me help you. What can I do?
163	210	They do like their football. - Trust me, it's like a religion.
112	547	By giving our Kraken the intellect and arms of an octopus, the vicious weaponry and tentacles of a squid, all blown up to gargantuan size, we've got ourselves a beast legend.
117	46	She thought about it and executed it for over 25 years.
120	523	Sarah, you know, maybe - Just let me finish.
121	15	Yep. Be right there. - All right.
130	579	I want you to see how much progress I'm making.
126	462	Reconnaissance? - Sizing up the competition.
119	227	It's, um, it's -- it's about meerkats.
165	382	That is at least half a day.
118	151	He is getting rich on the backs of our soldiers.
132	272	Not too fast if I've got anything to do with it.
128	417	And there's my move, so it's your turn.
151	522	You can trust us a hell of a lot more than you can trust Anson.
116	16	Let me try. Let me try. All right.
137	483	The problem is, we don't have enough evidence to use against him.
148	100	Well, the way I see it, Sam's got his hands full, and you need the help.
133	37	Frozen yogurt, Cocowalk 10AM, a friend
151	377	If you can call for the shakedown first
121	143	That Kimberly girl is a little wacky. - I thought her name was Angie.
127	451	What do you mean?  - Well, I finally realized that I was doing this all wrong.
116	609	Um, and have a-a wonderful evening, um, tonight.
122	67	Look, just talk to him. You know, Joe's a reasonable guy.
127	273	Um, we need to do this before Ginny goes to Mexico.
154	150	And it's gonna be okay, Maddy.
128	626	The corkscrew, the swimming pool, this... None of it was an accident, was it, Cooper? Hmm?
131	524	I've done this a hundred times.
134	490	Looks like we're good to go.
126	379	All right, what's going on with you?
164	198	move him closer to the ground.
124	538	I don't know where you and Kevin are, but I want you to know that if you ever need a roomy house, i promise that I will let you be the one to undress your husband.
136	306	Quentin acts like I’m a goddamn kid and tells me to go home.
152	340	No, you don't. - No, no, no!
144	174	You want to find Bailey, find the guy trying to kill him.
119	296	Oh, absolutely, absolutely. How about tomorrow?
144	260	But my gal said there's a tenant of hers, 219, and he matches the shooter's description.
124	52	I want theream ones, not the striped ones.
113	233	I'm telling you, stop it now.  - There are unnatural things among us...
162	1518	This isn't how we're supposed to be forever.
137	618	Use a code that's too complex, and you're just talking to yourself.
130	713	Okay. Yes, go get a seat. - You have a debate to do.
137	200	Don't you think he'll come himself?
112	1	The team investigates a giant see monster said to attack ships.
124	140	I don't know where that is, but my mom and everyone was really happy when he came home.
144	703	Has the FBI made sense of the whole scene at the girlfriend's house?
141	391	You both have to commit to this work. You owe it to each other.
158	75	Can l use the bathroom? [Scoffs]
113	879	Isn't that, like, the working definition of a bitch?
113	1151	There were Casters in the Civil War?
124	162	Okay. Well, why don't we just send the ney right down to the drug cartels?
120	505	I was just thinking the same thing about Justin.
140	586	Now, if you're gonna move the money you're gonna have to take him out.
125	381	Paige, which did you like best, France or Italy?
123	513	It hurts so much. - I know.
126	136	Come on, Holly. Can't you understand that this-- this
126	207	What-- what-- what happened now with the community bank you started?
134	186	Quinn Luna the guy behind the guy
154	480	Oh, I'll be sure to come back for you.
146	105	I’ll say," I am so sorry that your life is in danger…"
128	363	That's us. - Feels weird to me, you know...
154	447	You know what? Not interested. Now back off!
130	472	Why did you say all of that to her? - No, you have this all wrong.
150	39	I’m not gonna let a couple of security guards stop me.
128	551	Why couldn't I have just stayed home with Evan and his nanny?
140	334	I mean, the way the florida market is right now
119	122	You kids haven't even touched your duck.
136	44	Well, I don't have a job anymore, so there's nothing you have to worry about.
121	240	Will the straight cliches ever end?
154	456	Just 'cause you get out of this room doesn't mean you're home free.
114	500	If you stay... he'll forget you.
159	38	I cannot understand your complete obsession with this night of infantile debauchery that your so-called friends have planned for you.
164	469	but just right to have a liquid ocean...
121	48	Well, it starts at 10: 00, so, uh, 9: 45?
129	464	You know, Sarah, it's not too late to bail on this whole thing.
156	682	You want me to go undercover?
163	635	Besides, having a thick skin when it comes to pressure is a good thing in this line of work, right?
165	7	It is a very long way to fall from up there.
134	104	When a target is cornered, the best strategy is to flush them into a choke point, where they have two options -- surrender, or be shot.
155	537	I'll detail my involvement in every illegal activity I ever had a hand in, every operation
144	549	When communication lines aren't secure, and you don't want to tip that you're relaying sensitive information, you better disguise your message.
157	247	But this guy, Mike, I mean, he's seen the inside of every prison from moscow to minsk, so I think the best approach here is, we know everything, we'rerolling up his whole gang, and he's justa little fish.
140	531	Well, with the fbi's circling, got enough heat moving my own money.
156	110	All right, wake up. Come on.
150	372	How you doing out there, Pearce?
155	155	Nothing. - What? what do you got in here?
113	224	Me neither.  - My mama also says that...
112	215	And it's just going to snake those at you like a pair of anacondas.
146	232	We're going to make Carter look like an undercover cop.
148	85	at this point, it's the best lead we've got.
163	241	It says K. E. On the brim.
144	109	Hurricane Jesse here is doing more damage with a crowbar than Hurricane Dana did.
111	555	He's not gonna, like, kick her out of the house?
132	487	You would be fools if you weren't.
155	749	You've got good reasons for things, but... you do enough bad things, you become the bad guy.
114	207	Michael. Thanks for coming by the other night.
126	472	Listen, I was just-- I was looking around online and
118	662	It's an entire ocean under there.
127	747	I'm gonna take a moment... not a big one, not like, you know, forever...
144	603	They probably tracked him the same way I did.
161	410	I am freaking out!  - My parents are gonna kill me!
127	236	William screwed him over, and Dennis went to prison, and it was all a very long time ago.
127	95	Well, I... I thought the French liked to take a lot of time when they eat.
117	374	No, I understand, but patience isn't an option for me right now.
119	515	Well, I think she's in the kitchen begging McCallister not to leave.
125	243	Luc, don't do it. I'm gonna get a broom.
150	330	No, Anson. No. - I know - it sounds wrong, but it's not so bad, ultimately. If you do this, you and Jesse walk away clean and Pearce and three people you barely know have to get new jobs.
142	61	That's my way of saying thank you for the last time I saw you.
159	321	A jazz combo would be great.
145	184	Interrogating a captive isn't just about what you know about them.
117	646	I didn't want you to have to deal with anything before you were ready to deal with it.
117	619	I'm gonna ask you something now, and you have to tell me the truth.
140	282	What did I do... oh. Here we are.
118	423	I'm gonna grab a sweater. You want one, Justin?
154	578	Hey, think about what Sam said, how he couldn't live with himself
114	248	I kind of went the other way.
120	40	Okay, so when did you two fall in lust? - What?
117	645	I just knew your life would be harder than your brothers' and sisters'.
115	518	Well, I wouldn't gossip about it, but if I was the person who was doing something that was hurting someone,
118	78	Well, we may not be firing on all four burners, but we'll be serving food.
148	666	Well, let's hope we find Tavian before that.
141	660	Jesus, Michael. Vision? Are you serious?
145	84	It's my first job back. It's important.
162	1246	Don't jump too high. Wouldn't want you getting scared now, would we?
155	661	You want me to get you a controlled sedative, I need to know.
153	166	Uh, no, but look, it's like I told you guys.
145	502	Okay, we lost them. Where do I go?!
140	181	Try disconnecting a gps wired into a phone's motherboard,
159	118	Well, they should be, dear Sister. What we do affects everyone.
116	29	How much did they leave us?
127	687	What a riot. I... I think it's easier to plan a wedding than it is to stop one.
129	141	Okay. - Can you handle it?
162	1074	Leakey, so guess what I found down the garden shed?
126	446	The doctor said there's no rhyme or reason. I mean, y-your embryo could end up becoming the one.
119	98	They're wonderful-- -- Ducks for Easter?
145	461	If Takeda doesn't check in within two hours, they're killing the girls -- all of them.
163	119	Hi, I'm sergeant Sykes, tom, if you want.
130	144	Um... yeah, I was... I was married.
136	491	I mean, I’m flying in a d. J.From berlin.
131	173	She wants to see me... Today.
149	579	You did take my money, after all. Yes.
115	767	Nora, can I be honest? -Yes.
124	675	So... do you have a place?
115	510	All right, well, I'm not gonna tell them anything specific, but hypothetically, say you know the truth about something, but by saying it, you could potentially seriously hurt someone.
162	1163	She hasn't got one yet. Mum and Dad haven't had time.
146	472	Wait, Mike, are you saying that Carter is actually an undercover cop?
160	132	Tina, you fat lard. Come get some dinner.
142	159	I don't get what I want, and your brother dies.
161	197	No! I'm not doing drugs, Mom. I promise.
141	560	Why -- why would he kill me?
115	111	He has five kids and six grandkids, and I just want my family.
132	393	Olivia, we have to know that you won't do anything like this again.
122	62	I'm in the same lonely, sexlxless boat as you.
156	253	Sure. - Move that little ass.
162	1125	Then you'll wake up and, bingo, I'm gone.
150	134	Set up in a crumbling building covered in graffiti, and no one takes much notice.
164	388	with long, long, long tentacles hanging down...
116	391	He hugged you, and they popped out?
112	6	This thing is going to be the most fierce beast that I think we'll build.
113	832	Oh, that's right, blame the mother.
120	463	You just - Excuse me, Kyle.
164	413	They're simply spreading their seeds with these tiny little disks flying through the air...
117	270	I'm coming with you. Well, if he's going, I'm going.
112	2	I've never seen anything like that on any other animal.
161	250	That's a shame.  - Nah. Probably just as well.
125	564	Why don't we just go home... watch Evan sleep?
156	135	You'll find that my people are very generous.
131	577	Are you-what, do you think I'm crazy?
113	347	Voice of reason in a town of buttermilk minds.
152	311	I can't. I'm, uh, feeling a little under the weather, Mark.
132	462	And I am not one of your cases.
123	658	What, grade school was a blur? - I guess so.
146	425	Check behind the toilet, check under the rug.
122	722	Why am I always the fiancee, and you're the future husband?
119	364	I'm sorry. I was, um... sorry.
124	214	Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
155	1007	No, you have a hole in your side.
119	447	Or the gay task force meetings or the G.L.S.E.N. Fund-raiser last month or the G.L.A.A.D. Dinner last week
145	235	I control that particular import business here in Miami -- me.
148	415	Send it away. Send it away. Now!
116	601	I hope you will all have the opportunity to look at the literature that's scattered about and then you can learn more about us.
118	690	Even if we hadn't found water, I wouldn't trade that miserable bus trip for all the pizza in the world.
146	498	What the hell? - I’m out of ammo. You got some?
153	108	It's not just the guard. They've got cameras outside the elevators on every floor.
162	1259	That is a vile, unnatural brew, that is!
114	379	But when you do it for a cup of tea, it's, what, seduction.
158	605	All right, guys. Champagne time! Everybody.
131	630	I'm sorry, yes. Yeah. I'm sorry, too.
132	456	It will make you feel so fresh and just glad to be alive.
142	331	okay, I need you to meet me right now.
161	850	As for me, every time I look at where my pinky used to be,
112	313	The Kraken could reach to the top of the tallest mast.
149	93	We intercepted some calls placed by a weapons engineer, William Resnik.
115	586	We're supposed to be impressing Isaac.
122	112	Oh, no, no, no. You have to go. Come on, now.
127	105	Oh, no. He came back for all of us. Right, Luc?
120	680	Well, no more than my dad.
148	405	You guys didn't send a redirect confirmation for North Dade Airport, so, my boss calls me, tells me to come down here in person.
155	1130	Fi and Jesse tracked her here across three counties.
118	99	Where... Do you know where my... Yeah.
132	630	Yes, that's true. Some things are.
117	442	It's our way of telling you, you've lost your leverage.
147	505	He's from the Pyramid Group. F. Y.I. your security sucks.
154	606	Keep moving! - So we're supposed to just sit here?
137	882	I sent Sam down to do some research.
150	192	Ryan? Ryan! Do you copy? Ryan, do you copy?
155	308	Do you think you could contact -- Campbell?
158	237	Okay. We're－We're gonna take it from the second verse.
124	429	just say you got into politics because you thought reagan was cute.
155	233	Like what are we going to do about Jesse?
128	145	Uh, why do you look like Kitty at one of her fund-raisers?
129	63	It works every ti— And you know what?
128	175	You want a turkey and swiss? There's, like, 4 pounds of meat in here.
145	53	And we can all sleep easy at night.
121	228	Okay, you know what? You're actually now out of control. You are multi-tonguing two different women behind every closed door in this restaurant.
124	692	It's weird. I grew up thinking I'd never be a dad.
160	487	But you give 'em a good shakin', they'll settle down for ya.
142	56	I'm thinking a financial relationship, something that looks very suspicious, but isn't actually illegal.
142	533	Your current balance is 4,000. If you like
150	135	There are ways of figuring out if a facility is truly abandoned, however, like the power draw.
153	383	But sometimes, you have no choice.
119	76	How'd the vetting session go? -- Fine.
113	1271	Lena coming over for Christmas? We got enough food.
134	183	But none of it means anything without Erik's pretty face and clean record, so he's a little protective.
161	268	Two-buck Chuck.  - You know that wine?
129	578	What's all this? - Oh, a picnic.
137	1227	For the homemade variety, tile adhesive works best
152	27	It is about the status of the case.
132	30	How long is it? - It's ...
117	257	I don't like giving up, even when it's bad.
137	1362	Mike, you've been using the navigation thingy?
148	505	New plan --you're all going to that warehouse.
118	325	Kitty, I couldn't let them get away with it.
154	260	Okay, Mike, get a move on!
113	1196	a lot to take in, and I really got to concentrate.
113	1091	Macon comes here every day and reads every book he can for the Forbidden Spell.
155	962	Fi and Jesse can plant a bug and a tracker on her car.
140	398	Always appealing to my better half.
137	807	Take pictures of the birds and the local fauna, you know?
127	210	Suffice it to say, it's an opportunity that I've been looking for a long time, and most guys, I mean, they don't even get the call.
124	646	This was always the plan. - Plan?
150	366	One of the most useful tools in domestic-intelligence operations is local government.
152	609	Just a little bruise is all.
153	287	No, that's where Mike kept his, uh... vintage- sneaker collection.
140	449	Fbi? I'm running out of time here, man.
153	543	Thwarting a breach attempt typically involves meeting force with force, but if you want to buy yourself time without hurting anyone, you don't need firepower, you need a diversion.
161	286	I'm a real loser magnet. It's, like, on some unconscious level,
140	692	You sure you don't need a date?
122	128	We have two speeches there, an overnight...are you listening to me?
112	381	These feeding tentacles, if they're going to reach the top of the mast, that's 100'.
120	138	Well, you know what? He's right, kev.
127	192	On me? No, why?  - No reason.
156	586	Cameras seven, eight, nine, and ten.
164	460	to acid, to alkaline just about anything you can think of.
127	300	Oh, I don't know. Nothing. I'm being paranoid.
113	267	Hold on. "Some lose all soul and become mind.
147	321	Getting stuck behind enemy lines is one of the hazards of being a spy.
123	129	No, it's just, uh, I didn't know you were coming.
144	738	Could you please tell him that I couldn't make it and that he might have better luck next time if he brings me fresh yellowtail?
152	38	The FBI will find whoever killed Nate.
163	354	Tell me why you're so convinced that it was him.
129	640	No, never. - But they've read your books.
122	329	I have reputable advisors who are telling me that you should resign.
116	124	They will make him their cause. Take the high road.
159	152	Not to mention he's screwing the Ambassador's daughter.
124	608	Robert, I-I don't quite understand what you're not getting about this.
155	670	Could be Jesse, could be Michael, could be me.
144	42	Why not let Vaughn grill Simon about the Bible?
145	86	Cause that's what I'm talking -- there's a whole lot of girls that are going to die if we don't do something about it.
146	304	Stuff that's more important than getting rich? Come on. It'll take two hours.
131	128	Sarah? -  My cousin hal?
142	40	Jesus, bro, I didn't sayanything, all right?
113	1419	It doesn't really exist. There's no such thing in nature.
162	365	It's the sweetest of nectars, that is.
129	426	"womb envy"? What were you thinking?
158	94	l think what l'm about to do is completely ridiculous, but it can't hurt, can it?
131	213	Can I come to mom's tonight? Safer there.
148	428	Copy that. Adjusting course for Fort Lauderdale.
115	792	Oh, I love it when it gets cold in L. A. I slept so well.
159	213	Not for sure. Lynn might've mentioned something.
127	155	Uh, I don't know. He... he won't talk about it.
125	284	I'm just tired of listening to you allobjectify him, all right?
132	288	Well, there are a lot of things to do in washington, sarah.
145	487	He won't be out long, and we only have a few minutes before his friends get back.
163	301	He was arrested, and I got him off. I got you off, you son of a bitch.
113	423	That's... You must be a brain.
127	57	You'd be surprised.  - What's the problem?
120	26	That way, you'll save on heating and air conditioning costs.
117	353	And that means that Evan will have to stay with me more often.
120	168	I didn't expect you to take her to Frederick's of Hollywood for juniors.
120	293	Like your toilets and your budget, which is giving me a massive headache.
134	176	He's a big dealdown at the docks.
154	52	I-I started this address book before I got married.
113	1044	Lena bound your house. Oh, that's so sweet.
162	887	You're a pair of angels, you are.
161	272	And here I was all worried that you were gonna take me to some hip dance club or something.
118	185	I think watching soap operas and reading trashy magazines is a pretty harmless way of self-medicating.
132	91	Holly, I am not gonna go to new york without you.
121	662	Well... well, maybe she dropped it accidentally.
118	193	Is she gonna be like this the whole time? - No, no.
113	1107	Just look under “How Not to Turn Into Your Mother”.
164	345	GP-C 925 is smaller than the Earth.
119	387	Apparently she had some of the Robert McCallister kool-aid.
130	417	What are you doing here? - David's going through something, so I figured I'd come over and help him out.
146	408	The millisecond you get back, I’m going to need those papers, and I’m going to have what are you talking about, Vegas? You're coming with me.
150	267	I’d want to do it some place uncle Sam isn't watching, some place out of the country.
156	241	You don't know what the word means.
155	1181	We've had some vandalism in the area recently, and I need to check on everybody who agent Bly, Css.
140	247	Chances are good that this guy Eddie is talking to friends of yours.
125	57	But I'm covering the phones, and there's a guy on there who, uh, called and said he wants to talk to you, and he's not gonna take no for an answer.
153	89	Get your officers on channel 3. You're taking orders from me now.
155	208	Your body armor stopped the bullet.
116	569	It's one of the reasons why we came here, because she wanted to meet you.
112	352	That's if I don't die first.
155	679	We're covering 20 square miles, people, so... ...we got to move quickly.
140	58	If the operative they sent is any indication, it's -- it's heavy.
112	226	Going to be much more in line with the behavior of this Kraken to have these
142	312	Call log. So, there, I think we got a little bit of good news.
116	524	I'm asking you again. What do you say?
125	210	First of all, you have to - Well, I don't know what to do, mom.
147	506	He's not from the Pyramid Group, you moron!
153	296	Oh, so you're saying you would've done the same thing?
124	624	She did more than-- than just do the laundry.
115	176	And I would say this, you know, it's like, uh.
130	22	Well, you could always move home, Kevin.
124	697	I knew she really needed me and that I had to be the.
116	339	You-- you gotta talk to her.
136	486	Getting information from a club girl means buying drinks.
118	757	No. No, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.
151	391	So, uh, do you have it?
152	506	Of course, no blackmail attempt  can succeed if your target has no fear  of being extorted.
156	407	You may have to lower them just a little bit more.
111	243	I also came because... I saw something that night, and...
116	383	But you know what? I-I like tomatoes.
125	333	Oh, Kitty, you look beautiful. Doesn't she look beautiful?
122	665	Oh, yeah, stretches all the way across the state, from potawatomi to the illinois border.
131	341	No, no, no, no. I'm excited.
133	305	Anyway, last time I checked, he's part of a criminal syndicate run by pyotr Chechik.
116	687	How am I gonna go out like this? I mean, look at me.
112	453	This is a workshop for making movie special effects, which is cool.
161	788	Thanks for coming back.  - You kidding me? I had to do it.
137	387	I mean, if you don't give meany leads on Dave, there's not much I can do.
162	1609	The sun's beating down. They're not sure whether the wings'll work or not.
157	244	Well, they got him linked upto what they think is a Russian syndicate active on the east coast, pretty much from here to New York.
118	86	I'm so glad we rented the old ojal house for some peace and quiet this weekend.
155	890	I'm going to go check on the others. You okay, mom?
111	318	We were playing the Crime Spree, and he said he heard a gunshot.
153	524	Who is Sugar? This time, I want the truth.
147	619	Michael, your mom has told me so much about you.
144	618	James Bailey, open the door! ...Can be a challenge.
147	283	Turns out that job was a kidnapping. - Okay. Who was kidnapped? Jesus.
146	265	What, right after your whole murder and arson in broad daylight?
125	277	He can't see us anyway. He has chlorine in his eyesand dancing in his soul.
125	287	Kitty, for goodness sakes. I thought you were taking a nap.
152	617	It's got view of Miami Beach.
113	1111	The longer this thing takes, the more I see a change in her.
140	180	Almost anywhere on the face of the planet.
155	1035	So, listen, Mike, you promised me that you would make this right.
154	496	You'll bleed out in about two weeks.
147	111	And we put a head bag on Cahill.
161	261	You know that you're a better person than me, because, I hate to say it, but I just get irritated.
159	173	They're gonna give it to someone with more experience.
162	1209	When are they letting you out?
138	281	And you're hereto help me pack?
115	5	You slept with Lena, Tommy. I know.
129	186	Stop it, Sarah. You're making me nervous.
159	232	You got your gazillion-dollar trust fund, and your daddy's always gonna be there for you.
158	298	Mind if l throw some of my clothes in with yours?
162	1216	He lives in my garden shed.
152	639	House with a view of Miami Beach near MacArthur Causeway.
155	1127	Espionage methods are generally not approved by police or admissible in court.
119	655	We have a serious round of trivia to play, and I'm telling you right now, if we do not win, then I will make you regret it for the rest of your lives, and you know that I can.
120	318	I just thought we might get a few ideas...
145	185	It's about what they know about you.
119	726	All right, let's just leave it at that.
162	204	Are you a... Are you a junkie?
124	80	Bye, honey. - Well, I have great news.
161	221	It's been great having someone around who, like, likes me and isn't making fun of me or telling me to join the football team like my stepdad.
145	455	Sam, what the hell happened? You're supposed to be following them.
130	188	Okay. Well, then we'll both help you. - Yay.
113	827	Wasn't I the same before I was Claimed?
127	14	I know we will.  - Yeah?
114	29	there is only one true thing.
165	69	And after what they saw, they'll assume you've drowned.
127	723	You can still leave if you want.  - Why did I have to come back here?
150	566	Anson wasn't just planning on getting the team burned for stealing money.
116	112	Coded racial messages... and itlways works. It's as old as Nixon.
119	370	Mm-hmm. There's a discount for, uh, family members.
115	19	Adamson's lead continues to grow. Over senator mccallister.
165	534	And the last thing I'd want is for someone to get shot by accident.
119	224	if you'd want to get together sometime, you know, maybe go see a movie -- uh, someplace public, of course, so you don't have to feel scared.
151	196	Can I ask why you're driving a truck that belongs to Edward Rousch?
114	459	So there's no one that you wanna go back to?
128	576	I thought you didn't work for me anymore.
155	289	We could stay at her place.
124	464	Well, you can always get a job tomorrow if you wantne.
155	122	I'm going to keep watching. You guys make it quick.
131	563	I told you that in confidence, not so you could broadcast it to an entire room full of
135	186	Yeah, I don't knowwho you people are, but you've gotexactly five seconds to getthe hell off my property.
131	200	Have you talked to mom yet?
155	492	Michael says that you're a nice guy, and I could care less.
120	727	I'm in denial. - Oh, come on, mother.
127	420	And "Mccallister... don't ask, he won't tell.
137	405	Kent's keeping our little meeting a secret.
165	394	Well, you might as well say it, Robinson.
131	466	He doesn't have that many pb&js.
127	213	This job is... big. And if it happens, there's gonna be a place at the table for you.
153	353	Is there... is there something I should know?
164	378	And flight is something that's been done on Earth by a number of organisms in different ways.
124	345	For god sakes, I don't know why the two of them just don't shack up and get it over with.
123	648	What the hell are you guys talking about? - "A Christmas carol".
146	114	I did. They filed a report for property damage, and then they told her,"call back if it gets serious.
146	32	Hey, you know what I was thinking? This would be an awesome project for us.
124	113	No, no. I was just having-- - no, I-I know what you were doing. The place isugged, remember?
162	113	I better get started in here.
131	652	I've been trying to move forward for a long time.
154	128	If you're hiding in a safe house, that means keeping an eye out the window, having your weapon ready, and spending some quality time in front of perimeter cams.
127	128	Why don't you guys just get hitched?  - Hitched?
155	1195	You want to tell me what the hell just happened?
117	111	Yeah, okay, mom. Look, I gotta get to ojal.
114	438	Well, my point is that guys like us, work is family.
131	390	And can we go? Because we're gonna be late.
137	373	Yeah, well, I'm hoping for 7: 00.
132	133	yes. I - Yeah, that was
151	76	Sam, are you - It's me, Michael.
146	608	I answer one question, another pops up.
146	438	Carter undercover FBI agent hello. Gee, I wonder if these kids know that their daddy's a rat.
163	55	B. A.U.Behavioral Analysis Unit QUANTICO, VIRGINIA
161	546	You tell me what's going on now, Wade.
144	657	You were putting your ass on the line every day for people
154	532	I like that plan better. - Yeah, that plan is suicide, Sam.
152	272	No, no, no. That ain't the way it works.
137	245	That's not a very nice way to say hello.
137	1165	Lots of rusted metal, and they probably got him down in the hold.
141	466	Okay. I could run. Just -- just let me run.
119	524	Come on, mom. We've gotta give'em one of these.
131	507	Right. Well, I should probably stay for some pie, then.
125	506	You know, Holly, I thought we had that worked out months ago, but if you feel like I'm not contributing enough around here, why don't you just say so? And I'll write you a check.
162	1566	Are you sure you've got everything?
146	527	In 48 hours, he can give us new lives.
130	28	Oh, my God. The debate. Mm-hmm.- Yeah.
150	121	They're in at the firing range downstairs.
111	382	And who's going to question a guy like Dion getting shot in that neighborhood? Happens every day.
124	612	but the brain sex was good. - Well, yeah.
127	263	No.  - I mean, you guys aren't thinking of one day, you know...
146	97	It's Nate. He's picking me up at the loft in 15 minutes.
117	36	Yeah, and make sure I'm going to her party tonight.
126	401	Simon? Who is si-- what, mom's Simon?
118	30	How's this tie, good? It's... It's great.
115	818	Well, I channel surfed till I fell asleep.
132	235	Who knew the farmers' market could be so exhausting?
146	25	Thanks for the food, mom. I’m going to go fix the charger.
158	129	For this one l think you'll be fine.
145	353	I never gave him the shot.
120	607	You know what? I mean, he's right.
122	242	You will not believe  the family freak show  a Mccallister presidency  would foist  on an unsuspecting nation.
116	98	Mom, you don't get it. The only one that can help me now...
136	333	Next time i'll check my phone.
146	359	Selling this will bring half a mill, easy.
148	647	They know that once they get there, they can relax and let their guard down a little, which makes it a perfect place to send the cops after them.
125	318	Look, as soon as Kitty and robert leave,
162	332	Don't jump too high. Wouldn't want you getting scared now, would we?
117	220	Okay, so this is one of those where if you tell me, then you'll what, have to kill me?
141	671	He would never let you go to the military, Michael.
126	249	Ojai foods was yours, not William walker's.
161	676	Your knuckles are all bone!  - All right.
149	232	I'm gonna text you the address. See if she's in there.
148	194	There's a cold math to hostage-taking，once someone dies, things get worse quickly.
144	604	Great minds think alike, I guess, huh?
147	573	Coming here to live with an absentee boyfriend in his drab, little flat?
132	177	This is just one friend trying to help another friend.
118	446	No, they put it up in exactly the right places.
140	350	I got to go. All right? I got to run. I'll be in touch.
151	52	It's hard to interrogate your target if he's dealing with a gunshot wound.
145	140	She can't be all that bad.
123	501	How bad is it? - It's pretty bad.
115	872	I-I was just wanting to talk to him, that's all.
131	292	But for his sake, I hope that's not true.
123	77	Is that like a tasmanian devil?'Cause I think I shot one of those once.
152	593	You got a wicked amazing view here.
127	734	We're gonna miss you, Kevin. Great job.
153	286	Should I assume Westen's armed to the teeth now?
131	527	Okay, how you doing? - Almost there.
131	180	Oh, my god. It's completely absurd.
111	94	You don't want a good-bye party, then fine.
127	617	I don't feel brave. I practically ran out of there.
111	21	And you're sure that Rex is the father?
161	519	And I'll tell you another thing that's gonna happen.
119	520	They are -- -- Twister and operation!
139	352	Madison ak series, class ii, composite hardplate.
136	65	They know you're coming, so the question for them is whether they can destroy their equipment and get out of there in time.
127	664	Is he married yet?  - Excuse me.
122	424	You two, you deserve each other.
139	125	I got a son, man. He was born while I was locked up.
113	1080	It used to be under Washington, D. C. until Nancy Reagan made them move.
163	105	They don't smoke, they don't do drugs, they don't drink during the season, and they did not jeopardize a ful bright scholarship by cutting school and missing practice.
112	508	The canyon is part of a massive trench that stretches nearly 1, 000 miles and connects to one of the deepest spots on earth.
115	504	Yeah, well, the truth is we could totally shut him up, but we're not allowed to play by the same rules that he does.
161	502	We just called to say we're calling the cops on you, and we hope you spend the rest of your pathetic life in prison!
134	661	So you're saying I should eat a lot of yogurt?
122	630	You know, I-I-- look, I feel bad, but she's
137	1276	I have a proposal I'd like to discuss.
151	382	And a little free business advice
153	78	Fi, I need a door. Give me one exit they haven't covered.
142	316	Brennen's moving a lot of money, mostly to other banks, some numbered accounts, and a company...
124	357	But listen, you-- you cannot tell Saul. - No, I won’t.
153	181	Right, and once we run it, we're gonna have to keep running- forever.
162	483	It's calcification. The process by which the body hardens, becomes inflexible.
158	662	l pop a shoelace, swallow my gum...
131	589	Hey, are you guys here for the fair?
130	39	Nothing, but he feels bad about things. I-I can tell.
154	32	Madeline, you can't stay in Miami. - Well, what am I supposed to do?!
134	153	Erik's taking the son we had together, danny, and Joey, too, to punish me for leaving.
137	265	We got to talk to Mike.
141	111	It's not like you couldn't use a little cash to buy some of the luxuries in life like, hey, furniture, more protein.
130	488	Yeah. Your passive-aggressive behavior, - yes. - What do you call telling me about the loan?
151	67	Want to listen to the radio?
114	152	Who searches a database for me?
132	662	We will learn to get along, to trust one another.
125	262	Wait till you see what we got for aunt Kitty and Evan.
151	486	Airboats are built light with the least material possible, which is great if you want to skim quickly across the water.
161	340	Repeat, you got a bogie northbound.
117	471	He sold me out just to protect himself and his investments.
122	570	No, no, saul. He likes them well-done. Just put it back on the grill.
127	502	Oh, my god. What do I have to do to get rid of her?  - We have to find a map.
130	670	Well, you're in medicine. You know how sometimes you have to tell a patient that they don't need the crutches anymore, they can walk?
119	16	It's all a blur. I let people believe what they wanted...
113	94	As a requirement of this course...
126	549	Nah. It's more like I know what I want to say,
118	40	Hey, Justin. What are you doing here?
130	26	Wh... She called him because she needs help.
154	558	When you're in the field, the goal is usually to be in complete communication with your team to work in perfect sync at all times.
120	647	I-I-I accused her of using her cancer center as--as a way to avoid dealing with her lack of personal life, and I think I might have been talking about myself.
112	256	I'm going to try it. I can't believe you're doing this.
117	382	Rebecca transferred $2 million into ojal's cash account.
140	230	And Valentine is asking questions, all right?
132	611	No. It's your past, not mine.
162	1551	You don't have to worry, Dad. Not any more.
122	51	B, it is way too soon for either one of you to lawyer up, and c, if you and Joe get a divorce, I'll be stuck doing manly chores for you every weekend.
115	134	You gonna tell Scotty? -Why would I do that?
164	158	it provides us with an amazing wealth of information...
158	47	Excuse me? You're gonna keep your tongue in your mouth at all times...
131	120	Wait. That's my phone. It never rings.
129	184	It's not like he's getting it anywhere else.
159	48	Yeah, I know. Lynn's was absurd. I mean, imagine 20 college-educated...
133	267	Yeah, well, maybe i'll drag your ass back to that road as a peace offering.
157	177	Hey, um, so, Harvey, were you able to put togetherthat list of irrigationspecialists?
154	391	Ooh, that's a big can opener!
131	497	Well, you both have very different cultural references.
126	328	Sweetheart, are you all right? - I'm fine. I just always keep checking To see if it's swelling.
114	453	I mean, don't you miss someone?
120	72	Listen, honey, um, grandma's gonna pick you up and take you shopping for your party dress.
146	396	So I did a little, uh little poking around on the drug bust database.
134	564	The first is to accept failure and abort the mission.
148	307	Hey, Jesse, we have a hostage situation.
144	428	The guy's a suspect in a half a dozen hits, but we don't have so much as a description on the guy.
152	120	It starts as soon as I get the FBI file on my brother's murder investigation.
119	255	Oh, my. Did you ever meet him, Kitty?
124	96	He's kinda cute, huh? - No. Absolutely not.
164	454	These highly tenacious life forms are known as extremophiles.
115	120	Mom's hot for a republican. -stop it!
154	116	I've already taken over his contacts in China and the Yemen, and I'm closing a deal with the South Koreans even as we speak.
153	354	No need to worry, ma'am. We just need to know if you've heard from him.
150	26	Well, you put it all together, it makes sense.
122	334	I don't care what he was saying. I care what you were saying!
137	1237	Whoever's coming after me might have eyes on it, so i'll drive you and Nateup to fort lauderdale, and that's where i'll...find you another car.
162	1717	You just remember, them as can dance should dance.
163	566	I want you to look at the men in the picture and tell me if you see the man that did this to you.
147	263	Destroying high-tech electronics with glorified camping equipment is tough but not impossible.
155	240	Jesse: and then we were supposed to, uh, meet up in the everglades.
146	482	What'd he say? - Nobody’s missing Carter yet.
164	196	the prototype legs that can suspend a huge body.
137	1110	A force can be so overwhelming that no tactical approach in a fight is going to lead to a victory worth having.
146	43	Good for you. - Yeah. It is good for me.
150	349	And you deserve better than a life in prison.
120	389	Kevin, what are you doing? - I'm sorry.
115	819	I woke up at 3: 00 A. M. To an infomercial promising to cut the time it takes to peel an apple down to mere seconds.
151	589	And you can't tell the CIA about any of this because they're not my biggest fans.
146	236	Carter's never been arrested, he's from out of town, and he's moving up the ladder pretty fast.
119	217	Uh, as long as it's before midnight.
146	53	I don't think it's healthy to keep files on the people who ruined your life.
165	467	I've always remembered what you told me.
159	328	Well, George Szamos said he set up a meeting with you...
153	283	I'm going to catch your friends, Mr. Axe.
146	400	You think he's undercover? - da - how long you known this Carter guy? - No way. There's no way he's a cop.
125	499	Well, sometimes, mom, you gotta let up.
161	709	These are the Siamese queers I've been telling you about!
113	486	Yes, there are evil Casters, Ethan.
156	104	Is he- Just--I need you to get back, please.
146	521	I’m calling my guys. I got somebody at the port with a boat.
162	1131	I have to keep moving, me.
146	146	He's moving up the ranks pretty quick. The guy's a real pit bull.
130	36	What? - The... the bag sold out.
140	94	Well, he was at your ma's house when I got there.
148	291	Man, like Ward said, we checked this building.
137	105	There's another one coming in this week.
114	290	Should we do the bathroom again?
154	192	Guys, if Vanek is here, we need to leave right now!
120	82	Listen, I know you're not thrilled about supporting Sarah, but I really think it's good, cheap advertising.
118	364	Justin, I want this opportunity. This is a huge step forward for me.
136	553	You two are in a lot of trouble.
165	442	But all it says is: "Robinson, son of a stranger.
113	779	Don't you look pretty.  - Ethan?
140	488	I mean, if you really want to find a new place, you know, you're gonna have to eventually go inside  one, Sam.
141	437	That's because he's killed most of them, Mike.
116	76	Oh, well, what day did you reschedule it for? Maybe I could go with you.
164	385	The strangest of the airborne creatures one could imagine...
136	255	It's always useful to be able to disable a car remotely.
115	380	You know, I am happy to tell you about my past.
121	542	Uh, here are your car keys. - Oh, great.
137	291	How's your dance with Cowan going?
164	401	that extend 15, 20, 30 feet into the air...
126	421	Paige, look at that! It's gigantic.
164	501	and on the surface, ice, a lot of ice...
130	693	Well, you have to take this with a grain of salt.
135	399	You know, like foreign guys who want a condofor their girlfriend.
150	385	Who are you kidding, Ryan? You can't spell "sudoku," much less play it.
118	788	It's all right, Robert. - Kitty! Kitty! Oh, no, no.
119	237	You know, it would save me a lot of time if we just did this all at once.
165	233	I'd never doubt one of them.
120	85	Is he still in Ojai? - Yes.
154	451	Cable's tight. What do I do now?
121	378	He's gonna come around. - Mom's right. He... he... he's gonna come around. You'll see.
150	415	Well, that's just it, I don't know, but I know fi, so...
130	559	Oh, I know. It makes you really crave a big...
153	442	When this photo was taken six months ago.
130	34	She wants your help because you're... you're a lawyer, and she wants Scotty's help with what she calls "the Debuttal".
154	368	Maybe we should consider other options, even desperate options.
121	161	and to give them my blessing.
137	1324	When it doesn't work, commandos get killed just as dead as anyone else.
146	545	Meet me out back in five minutes.
117	644	the world was different then. It was a lot less tolerant and...
140	44	See, Mikey, the people we work for,
131	354	I - I had no idea that you still played with toys.
161	328	There's a lot of heads that want to feed off of this, man. Don't let us down.
144	162	Look, these Turks -- they're into drugs, human smuggling, murder, you name it.
129	91	Yeah, well... They don't call me "turbo" for nothing.
148	377	Special Forces? What are you talking about?
121	216	Now when Luc was small, what was the one dish you would cook for him that was his absolute favorite?
113	1219	to give life to the one she loved.
117	387	Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time.
146	457	You're in charge, but we're both in danger.
156	189	Maybe he could recoup a little revenue.
120	569	A lot of people would've said F.D.R.
160	155	It's just that simple. Now, I want you to kick me.
129	267	No. God, no. I can't go up against dr. Alex.
141	465	You know how easy you'remaking this for me, Drew?
130	285	And, you know, I... - mom, did you...
158	673	Twenty-five bucks? No freaking way. l'm rich!
136	458	It's not going anywhere. -You know what i meant.
130	644	When you didn't show up to my opening, it hurt so much.
158	550	that the band decided not to play.
122	330	Oh, what, and capitulate to Luther reeves?
158	505	Okay, guys. Spread out, find him. All right.
163	550	Hutch, do you mind if I
140	10	You know how she loves these things,
126	327	But I'm just glad that Paige accepts their help, because god knows, she does not want mine.
113	1442	Macon said this was the only way to protect you both.
124	155	No. Actually, I talked with Yelena who talked to Lauren who's engaged to Joe.
140	701	And that's where these come in?
163	254	He certainly seemed to know he had the time.
142	75	Whether Nate's meeting ends in a bullet or a handshake is entirely up to you.
164	422	would enjoy an adequate amount of water on GP-C 925.
112	39	My job is to find one, catch it, and get it onboard our boat for a close-up look.
126	662	I used to dream that you would sleep past 7: 00. Here you go.
119	144	They had five kids, and they were all the same ages.
159	146	designed to scare us into oil exploration.
144	29	But you guys aren't seeing the silver lining here.
122	310	Yeah, well, that wouldn't be the first time, Lucifer.
128	639	No, I'm not mad at you.
146	192	You want to turn it into nice, untraceable cash?
131	608	Um, did you find some pottery at a garage sale?
118	502	Where the hell is he going? - You know, I don't know.
145	411	But we're meant to be together!
130	331	Chris, can you give us a minute?
125	469	How did it go? - Oh, it was fun.
124	570	that was enough. - Why are you mad at Roger?
158	246	Wow. That's great. Yeah. Well, besides the fact that it's a huge space...
128	722	I'm not gonna break anyone's heart.
132	110	She's excited. She thinks her family's gonna be together again.
130	163	Maybe you should've thought of that before you cheated. - Yes, I should have.
151	518	I do, Rebecca. I know you better than you think.
158	55	and he is our mud king.
114	460	Even if there was, you can't go back.
115	700	No, it's fine. I don't need to go.
128	13	Grandma, can I set this up in the living room?
122	358	Well, if you're free now, there's a roomful of boxes - that need to be labeled and catalogued. - Sure.
156	158	He does some computer security work.
117	15	I have a whole year to prepare for complete decrepitude.
140	320	You come to me. You know what? I'm gonna get the cheak.
141	345	Sorry to interrupt, fellas, but I need to borrow this guy.
127	343	This is a good thing.  - No, no, no, no. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Sarah.
120	232	So long as we make a good impression, you know, a young, hip, cutting-edge impression.
153	436	Look- you can see the mark where it hit the boat.
111	542	It's gonna be okay. Yeah. We meant what we said.
136	605	No, there is no time for that.
136	164	State-Of-The-Art. Want me to show you around? -Mm-Hmm.
163	484	We talked to the hotel manager, peter.
160	447	[ Door Closes ] - [ Engine Starts ]
118	214	No, it's not... It's not that. He should get tested, Kevin.
141	83	They put us out there, tell us the end justifies the means, and sooner or later, you believe them.
164	103	Taking the hydrogen from the water...
141	322	There's amateurs on this. Gonna be cops all over it.
154	134	Keep an eye on the house or on me? That's what I thought.
163	69	My daughter and her 2 friends, they've been missing for 5 days, and I know someone took them, but no one will believe me.
130	23	You know, I spoke to, uh, Scotty yesterday.
146	539	Or shake down high rollers and fix fights in Vegas?
159	97	And have you had an adventure?
159	81	and she's a model and she's done some film.
128	109	Kevin, don't be upset. - I'm not upset. I'm just busy.
165	462	Remember how I told you I named places on the island after things that mattered most to me?
154	252	No. But I do have the next best thing.
120	303	Well, I-I don't have a date for the greenatopia party.
126	507	And unless you made those lemons fall with your mind,
126	711	Nora, you-- you didn't have to do all this.
148	235	check it against the employee records, make sure everybody's here.
115	783	We drank too much, and it was just.
154	607	Yeah. I don't like it either, but yeah.
147	69	I suppose you could call it that, yes.
141	291	Yeah, whose Saab is that out front?
130	398	Kevin, I thought we were trying to stick to the task at hand.
147	417	Now, you stay put, and we'll be out of your hair before you can say, "Life's too short".
141	139	I know yougot to be starving, too. You want some, uh, eggs, honey? Over easy?
130	194	You know the hardest thing about all this?
132	648	If there's any more stealing, there will be consequences.
118	331	I had to respond. - Oh, my god.
128	433	King me, grammy! - I'm not going to king you.
126	480	Fine. I wash my hands of it. - Okay. hi.
150	367	One call from the cia, and most federal and state agencies will help out if they can.
124	273	A gift? For me? About you?
160	63	This one gang kept wanting me to join 'cause I'm pretty good with a bow staff.
130	553	I've been focused on my family my whole life.
125	208	Here we go. -  I'm not gonna do it.
136	196	So I got my ass down to miami. Pete jordan, hey.
120	394	You can't see past your own bias to see I kicked your ass.
141	150	And now he killsfor a living.
146	384	Now let's go and see the photos.
129	213	Actually, Justin... We don't really talk about robert very much.
148	361	Not yet. We're still the best chance the hostages have of getting out of here alive.
112	420	Now, you're just looking at the tip.
128	680	Now I know we talked about Luc moving in, and you were excited about the idea of it.
150	223	There. -  Oh, thank you. Thank you.
139	267	You are so sweet, and you make me feel so good.
128	238	I'll be there in two minutes. Love you, ma.
131	542	Yeah, I'm working on a novel, uh, right now.
158	230	When you guys write it. Right.
159	451	You okay? - I think so.
123	653	Nope, nope, drawin' a blank. - Yeah.
158	53	[Man] l am a mud man.[Woman] l am a mud woman.
134	91	No. I'm cooking at my place.
145	368	Rough? Why don't you just hit me?
146	596	I think you should see this through. Right?
144	522	Just tell me where the neighborhood is
137	947	You think they're the Same guys that shot Cowan?
151	169	An hour away? Take old Porter road. You can make it there in 40.
132	221	Now I am gonna go home and take a shower.
131	587	Connect with? What, is this speed dating? I'm sorry, Scotty.
127	31	Because my mom's doing that big dinner for Luc.
131	643	I mean, I've got a busy schedule... No, okay, Annie... And I-I've got things.
122	505	Uh, the ligaments are all repaired, however, there's still nerve and tissue damage.
142	343	That said, you try a little harder with some civilians than others.
142	253	Actually, I understand he's a bit of a gun nut, which means he's less likely to call the cops and more likely to just shoot you.
116	58	Oh, yeah. Well, she never loved Kluve the way we did.
119	47	I -- I was supposed to be interviewing the fraternity brother and
113	1398	Let me go! She's more powerful than you.
122	191	Oh, wow. That's good. - Yeah, it is.
138	232	See, you can'ttrot a kid out in public with a bomb strapped to his arm, but I had this nifty idea
154	491	Oh, damn it, Schmidt's pinned down. - They're at the southeast door.
152	429	Quinn's not coming to see you.
129	220	Is the first thing that's made me not think about robert so much.
136	59	If it's got a battery, it's disposable, short-term.
117	553	Oh, and how much is that gonna cost?
113	1383	It's all right, it's all right, Lena.  - No.
145	253	...I hadn't seen that in a long time.
165	344	You've been a good friend, but I can't be that selfish.
140	705	Notorious for causing brush fires, 12-gauge incendiary rounds create a small explosion
158	138	You can have the job, but it's my old job.
129	269	Okay, okay, mom, you're the underdog, no question about it, but that might be an advantage.
125	65	I've already put a depositon a block of 30 rooms at the Hakalea Regency.
128	166	Cause ever since the funeral... - No, no, I really am.
132	161	But that's no reason to badger you into doing something you're just not ready to do.
144	745	Number two, actually, but that's still high enough to make our weekly podcast.
162	321	I'll get round to it, I promise.
145	129	Some of the most important secrets in the world have been protected by a guy with a few stories and a drink in his hand.
132	2	When a child finds out there's a real possibility they've found a home, it can trigger a lot of anxiety.
119	640	We're supposed to be on the same side, not in here bickering with each other! What can you
116	542	It's the same thing. Did you wear leather?
118	629	What, is there a moratorium on compassion around here?
137	323	See, you're way ahead of me.
116	355	Are you sure you entered the right race, Robert?
144	38	No. It's a disturbance in the force.
121	664	You know what? I'm just gonna peek in there and make sure it's not the good china.
148	370	All right, well, I-I guess I can't let that plane land.
141	592	Hey, Fi. Don't be a hero here, all right?
137	175	So, to what do I owe the pleasure of this invitation?
163	614	All I did was show them who they really are, what they were truly capable of.
137	22	Cause if you're takingher side on this whole cholesterol thing, it's gonna put a serious strain on our friendship.
162	1054	And you're the closest thing I've got to a neighbour.
147	68	I was hoping you could get it for me. - You mean steal it for you.
123	214	I've been trying to be a grown-up.
155	421	If they're dumb, you trick them.
113	596	My powers will be claimed for either the Light or the Dark...
128	687	So when you hurt his feelings, you hurt my feelings, the same way that I'd be hurt if somebody hurt you.
141	82	I thought, "finally. Finally, he wakes up. Finally, the kid gets it."
147	542	You're a man who knows what he wants. Trust me.
126	578	I sang a medley from Grease, Including the Sandy numbers.
146	422	Looks like you're going to bleed a little bit more. Now shut the hell up.
135	523	Oh, it's the old"we're all in this together"?
113	227	Emily, shut up.  - My mama says the same thing.
141	88	Don't pretend you're some kind of boy scout, Michael. I know better.
155	252	We've been monitoring traffic feeds on roads into the everglades.
138	30	I'd also love to know why somebody who's normally socareful to keep his mouth shut has suddenly blossomed into such a storyteller.
124	137	He was a doctor in the army. And he went to, um... where'd you go?
161	683	All right, new rules!  - Okay.
150	411	Yeah, Mike. Uh, we got to talk.
125	47	Good. Then get back to visualizing fireworks.
118	12	I'm not gonna have any time.
116	372	By the way. Why don't you try preserving the one that starts with "all men are created equal"?
134	439	You fall apart, Erik, and I swear to god
130	661	The thing is, my shift just ended, so I was just about to leave.
153	232	We need to grab whatever we can at the storage unit, switch cars and find out where the hell Sam is.
126	470	I know Simon gave you an explanation, But I found something out about him.
123	351	Did you know that? - Of course I know that.
127	312	That was Brian. He'll be here any sec.
128	281	Pull it from Ojal and transfer it into your personal account and make an offer.
160	418	I don't even have any good skills. - What do you mean?
146	307	You mean mouth. No, I think it's teeth. Point is, you never cut out Trey.
131	41	You didn't have to stand in line.
131	559	Well, you know, the problem is, is I don't want to shout.
158	157	[Muffled] Come on, boys. Move it or lose it. Let's go.
120	305	Greenatopia? - It's.it's.it's nothing. It's just my son.
123	393	Oh, I don't know. Maybe get his mind off of things a little bit?
160	104	Let me see what your best move is.
140	361	Leave the phone on. I'm gonna go get Fi.
122	264	The white house is a symbol  of all that's great  about our country.
147	396	Don Juan, you and Romeo grab some men and sit on Cahill.
116	352	I just want to make sure that you bring your a-game.
113	905	Here, I gotta give you the money, heh.  - Heh.
153	390	When someone on your team gets a surprise, you have to hope they realize there's a plan in motion and they can find a way to be part of it.
159	415	I'll drain my accounts. I have enough.
153	122	Where's the ice machine? - Sir, you need to go back to your room.
115	594	Back into your psycho- melodramatic-romantic. -"psycho-melodramatic"?
116	748	Well, maybe this isn't the right time to be sensible.
150	130	It's good to have you back on the team.
132	654	Okay. Then tell us. Who are you?
132	376	I'll just go in front of the board, tell them I think you did the right thing.
164	465	that in order to get life off the ground on a planet...
127	147	Yeah. Yeah. As a business arrangement.  - You never told me that.
112	505	Picture how disappointed the Kraken would be if there's nothing to eat but a couple of bony sailors.
154	516	I hate to repeat myself, but Schmidt needs to go out there and work this out with Vanek.
156	348	Mark does his best work in an Aeron chair.
137	1065	Uh, Mike, it's for you -- something about your burn notice.
129	433	No one wants to listen to you if you aren't famous, and have a fancy title, and a string of letters behind your name.
145	267	Pretty hard for a foreign operative to get close if you're sitting right next to him.
118	134	That's pretty remarkable.- I did a bike-a-thon.
159	185	Think he's gonna need it. - Okay.
126	92	I just don't want to see you waste your time.
146	583	I don't want a lecture, Nate. - well, I’m not lecturing you.
142	568	Um, it's okay. It's a little bit sore.
123	298	He also called me "little miss officer," your honor.
128	60	Ojal's gonna have to sell some more land to pay for this.
158	449	You're still going? Oh, yeah. We have V. l.P. tickets. Why waste 'em? You?
153	580	To kill you, too? Yeah, Mr. Axe told me your sad story.
147	530	How was the ride over? - Oh, it was a pleasure cruise.
148	315	Yeah. What --what do you want me to do?
148	36	"I'm pretty sure" isn't what I want to hear right now.
137	306	Um, this new client of mine -- Gillian.
125	445	Come on, Kevin. Just be the girl. Please.
123	390	so I might discuss with you the advantages of the pain medication?
132	615	I was rude to you yesterday, very rude, and I - I want to apologize.
129	482	Um, I’m-I’m- It's just-just a meeting.
127	123	I think I overbooked myself.  - Well, it's not like - we knew how long we were gonna have you for, right?  - Yeah.
164	112	they immediately create a burrow, where they primarily live.
144	468	After that, removing the steering wheel just takes a little leverage.
150	141	Yeah, I don't do charts. - Look, the point, miss no-attention-span, is that there's a spike every a. M. And then another one around lunch.
162	242	Are you all right? Are you OK?
164	581	It's the science and engineering that tries to put together a mind by understanding how the mind works...
163	82	At 9: 35 P. M. During the town's pep rally for the high school football team, both Kelly and Polly called home.
160	335	Bred for its skills in magic.
132	296	For two weeks, not to restart your old life.
115	768	From one parent to the other? -Yes.
118	314	Hey, what's up? - Oh, god.
145	459	She translated the last bit of the conversation.
117	391	Well, not without a drink. Open that up.
113	1319	How will I know if it worked?
117	677	Mm. How was Kevin's party? Was it a complete disaster?
152	227	You want a light frame so you can maneuver faster than your target...
114	103	Maybe it wasn't you who creeped him out.
137	1137	Ooh, that's nice --a little dry, but sometimes dryis a little refreshing.
148	66	Plus, I got this corporate-security gig I told Jesse I would do.
152	48	Just let me deal with it.
140	328	Well, I'd need to see where this real estate  is.
155	671	I need enough sufentanil to knock everyone out and its inverse to keep them from o. d.ing.
116	424	She even thinks her hair's not gonna fall out from the chemo she's already had.
119	733	who's mad at who, who knows what secret.
127	644	Do you hear me? I... it doesn't matter.
151	19	You were working with Anson the whole time.
150	204	Grab him after his security team leaves but before takeoff.
128	20	Luc's convinced she's gonna come home a whole hey.
118	240	Um, well, I-I didn't do anything wrong, did I?
126	790	I'll wait while you get everybody.
135	470	Fi and I have to u pdatestrickler on the cleaner job.
125	307	So how did they handle the news about Kitty?
146	275	How'd it go? - I’ve had better jobs. You plant the tracker?
160	40	No, she's getting her hair done.
124	329	Uh, I was checking on our boy in there.
111	387	See if we can establish contact with the shooter.
120	468	You saved me. - Well, you don't deserve saving.
150	159	You need to know when his flight arrives, what vehicle he's driving, every detail down to where he's gonna make a left turn.
145	544	Who are you? - "Who am I?"Doesn't matter.
139	236	Sounds like building security's getting curious. Call you back.
144	508	Usually, only career Marines get a moto tat like that.
162	650	Well, who is it, then, Michael?
144	364	You'd be doing him a favor.
164	585	seem to think that that's likely to happen within 20 years, 50 years, 100 years.
112	44	He's been tracking and catching them for thirty years.
132	9	Yeah. - Does she know about the weekend visits yet?
153	182	Mike, you had a bug in that hotel room with Gray, right?
146	480	Once you stop, we'll go in hard.
146	92	We've always known you've been a little crazy, but we just don't want you going crazy crazy.
161	875	It wasn't that bad. - Come on, let's go.
151	437	Think you can walk in here with that bomb and rip us off?
148	423	He will tell you, if you want to keep your job, you will keep my runways clear.
123	635	You are part of the family, rebecca.
118	636	I have to get the number.
140	472	Did you say anything to them?
158	482	Oy! We're never gonna get a cab at this hour.
129	95	Yeah, well, at least at the end of this, we had a gorgeous view instead of a credit card bill.
147	194	Who the hell -- - that's why it never hurts to attack from two angles.
137	1281	If you don't, if you even come near me before that, I will put a bullet in my head.
117	542	Well, sadly, I don't think that it is confusing.
130	149	I think I'm allergic, actually. My tongue swells up, and I can't talk. It's weird.
122	580	yeah. - So just water. Thank you.
155	1257	A coast guard patrol boat is armed with two . 50-caliber machine guns and a 25-millimeter cannon, which means it can take out anything short of a battleship.
155	44	You don't look so good, Michael.
163	192	She'll be back after the game, you'll see.
148	519	They were here. They were here. They --he must have took them.
140	642	There's still time. We can make this right.
151	328	Oh, of course, sweetie. Bill, come out for a photo.
123	652	What? Fifth grade, Mrs. Blake? Muumuus, orange lipstick?
146	255	Next time, it's your skull! - Please, stop.
156	150	What do you know about hacking?
151	180	Okay, okay. Enough with the questions. Step on it.
117	585	what are you doing here? I don't want to talk.
155	291	Sam's in no shape to move.
162	307	Given up on life, has he?
138	122	When I think about whatmight happen to him, I...
152	521	Someone who knows about your father's bank accounts, and I don't mean just the ones he jots down on his tax returns.
140	77	I'm a friend of the family. - Mm-hmm. On your feet.
118	213	Oh, he can't hear us. - The walls are, like, oak.
164	282	This creature would live most of its life...
129	144	There is just... One slight hiccup.
158	667	Hold still. Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! [Groaning]
151	470	And now you're calling other girls?
123	587	And you better she's better whit us this is right thing to do she's be very crever, ben you ...may think, this is right thing to do?
126	75	I mean, are you-- are you all right? - Yeah, I'm thrilled.
137	180	So I thought - - of me!
144	40	Vaughn is the only one who can put me in a room with him.
163	12	Besides, did I ask you not to go to the pep rally?
113	646	my holdings do give me a little leverage.
123	469	I blame you, Tommy. I want to get past this.
